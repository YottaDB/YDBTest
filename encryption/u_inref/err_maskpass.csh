# This test verifies whether $gtm_exe/plugin/gtmcrypt/maskpass handles the below error conditions in the user environment
#  1. $USER not set -- Required for getting the user id which will be used to mask one part of the unobfuscated password
#  2. $gtm_dist not set -- Required for getting the stat information of $gtm_dist/mumps
#  3. $gtm_dist/mumps executable doesn't exist -- Required to get the inode number of $gtm_dist/mumps executable to mask
# 	the second part of the password
#  4 thru 7 are valid cases. Note: the combination of cases 5 thru 7 verify that the same password with a different
#	obfucscation file produces a different obfuscationed key.
#  8. Use invalid value for gtm_obfuscation_key.
#  9. Use non-existant filename as value for gtm_obfuscation_key.
# 10. Use an unreadable file as value for gtm_obfuscation_key.
# 11. Use a non-regular file as value for gtm_obfuscation_key.

# This does not need any database activity and hence no dbcreate
