# Enable white-box testing and trigger errors in the midst of commit. Do not do that very frequently as that might
# slow down GT.M update rate (due to frequent cache recoveries). We want to do this in the stress test to ensure that
# errors in the midst of commit are handled properly in all possible configurations (the stress test tests a wide
# variety of codepaths by running as many processes concurrently as are allowed e.g. mupip load, backup, reorg etc.).
# Note that white-box testing is active within GT.M only in case of a dbg image. Therefore in case of a pro image,
# this white-box testing block does not change the code coverage of the test in any way.
