# 3) Add the below two automated test cases (scenario described in detail in the below email).

# 1) Create 3 replication instance files, db and jnl files in 3 different directories. Let us say the instance names are A, B, C.
# 2) Now that the instance file is empty in A, replicate 10 updates from A -> B (i.e. A primary, B secondary).
# 3) Shutdown replication servers in A and B.
# 4) Recreate instance file, db and jnl files in A.
# 5) Now that the instance file is empty in A, replicate 10 updates from A -> C (i.e. A primary, C secondary).
#    Note: These updates should be DIFFERENT from those done in step (2).
# 6) Shutdown replication servers in A and C.
# 7) At this point, B and C have 10 updates each of which was generated from A. But those 10 updates are logically different.
#    Therefore they should be treated as completely out of sync i.e. their resync point should be seqno 1 even though their current
#    jnl seqno is 11.
# 8) Start replication from B -> C (using existing instance files, db and jnl files).

# Should be getting the INSNOTJOINED error in step (8) with v55000 and that is the correct behavior.  With pre-v55000, you wont get
# that and replication will proceed fine between B and C which is incorrect.

# Modify subtest (3a) slightly as follows.
# Instead of A->B followed by A->C, take a case where you have two different directories. Under one, let one
# person do the A->B replication steps (1) to (3). In the other directory, let another person do the A->C
# replication steps (4) through (6). That is, two persons are doing the exact same thing at the exact same
# time in two different directories on the same system with the only exception being the secondary instance
# name (B in one case, C in another case). Even if the system time did not go backward, it is possible that
# the instance A had its history record created with the exact same timestamp in both cases. Therefore,
# we still have the issue of B and C being treated as in-sync when they are actually out-of-sync.
