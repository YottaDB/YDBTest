# 6) Test -noresync & -updateresync interaction.
#    That is as part of a -noresync startup, if ever the receiver has to go PAST an updateresync in the instance file, it works fine.

# 42) Test of -noresync
#    A,B are in one LMS group. P is in a different supplementary LMS group.
#    A->B and A->P replication is in effect.
#    A does 10 transactions. Only 8 of those go to B. But all 10 reach P before A gets shut down.
#    So A,P have 10 updates while B has only 8 of those.
#    Now B comes up as primary. Now bring up A as secondary to B. One needs to do a fetchresync rollback on A.
#    It will produce a lost transaction file containing 2 updates (updates 9 and 10).
#    Now start source server on B to replicate to P.
#    The receiver server on P, which has been running all this while, should connect fine with B.
#    But it should detect that P is ahead of B and error out.
#    The source server on B should continue to be up and running. Only the receiver should have errored out.
#    Restart the receiver server on P with the -noresync qualifier.
#    This time around it should work just fine. A new history record with strm_index of 1 and strm_seqno of 9 should be written in P
#       indicating this is a -noresync type of history record.
#    Also verify that an EPOCH record gets written in the journal file by the update process with a strm_seqno of 9 for strm_num=1.

# 7) Test -noresync does nullification of only a PART of the history
#    Start with -noresync and see that it truncates a portion of the history.
#    Do some updates.
#    Later shut this receiver down.
#    Start a fetchresync rollback with the same receiver instance but a DIFFERENT source instance (maybe a backup of the above primary
#    taken at a prior instant in time) such that the common sync point is BEFORE the point where -noresync stopped. We expect
#    rollback to error out with NOPREVLINK error because -noresync would have nullified the prevlink.
#
# This is no longer a concern, as noresync doesn't nullify history, it is possible to rollback prior to a -noresync.  So we check here
# that it works correctly.
