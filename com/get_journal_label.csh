# Script to determine the Journal file label
#
# Input:
# 		$gtm_dist
# Output:
# 		If ${1:h}/inc/jnl.h does not exist, report UNSUPPORTED.
# 		Otherwise AWK should find a value.
#
# NOTE: There is only one caller of test/com_u/get_journal_label.csh,
# test/64bittn/u_inref/upgrade_and_start_repl.csh. If this script is run
# outside of the usual FIS environment, both versions under test will see the
# same journal version, UNSUPPORTED. As such the test will skip checking for
# YDB-E-JNLBADLABEL.
#
# However, if the external testing environment has attempted to set up GT.M
# development style builds, there is no telling how this test will operate.
