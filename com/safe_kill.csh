# PID Length as of 2014.07.30
#
# Linux PIDs go up to 32768 (cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max), but the value can
# be raised to 4194304 (2^22) which is seven digits long. So we should be safe
# there.
#
# Solaris
# (http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-4015/chapter2-107/index.html) can go
# upto 999999 six digits long.
#
# AIX, I know PIDs go up to eight digits long, but I can't seem to find
# anything in their documentation via searches. This command
# 	lsattr -E -l sys0 | grep -i maxuproc
# gives me the max processes per user. This link,
# http://www.unix.com/aix/84085-pid-number-creation-rules-aix.html (which
# references another supporting link), says the the max pid is 2^26, 67108864
# which is 8 digits long.
#
# HPUX (man process_id_max) PIDs are usually set to 30000, but can go up to a
# ridiculous ten digit length 1,073,741,823. Wow! And here I thought I was
# leaving myself room to grow!
#
# Mac OS X, PID_MAX is 999999 (see sys/proc_internal.h)
#
# Windows ... couldn't find an answer
