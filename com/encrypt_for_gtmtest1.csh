# This script takes the current user's database key as an input, decrypts it, and re-encrypts it with gtmtest1's public key.

#
# Usage :
#  $1 - key to be encrypted for gtmtest1
#  $2 - output file where the encrypted key has to be stored
#  $gtmtest1 contains the username of the other user, which, for all practical reasons, is gtmtest1
