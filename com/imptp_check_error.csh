# $1 - output file containing imptp.csh invocation output

# This script checks if the imptp.csh output has any errors.
# It searches for -E-, -W-, -F- and if so issues an error and exits the calling script.

# Every script that calls imptp.csh should immediately afterwards call this script to check for imptp.csh errors.
# This ensures the calling script (usually a subtest driver script) does not continue past an imptp.csh
# invocation that errored out as it could otherwise lead to hard-to-diagnose subtest hangs (see YDBTest#431 for details).

# It is possible some caller scripts (e.g. "ideminter_rolrec/u_inref/wait_multiple_history.csh") have "set echo" or
# "set verbose" on and redirect the output to a "*.out" file. In that case the "-E-" in the grep command below would
# show up in the output and be flagged by the test framework as a false failure. To avoid that, "unset echo" and
# "unset verbose" while doing the grep.
