# This central script is invoked by the test system whenever it needs to do a mupip journal rollback.
# This script checks the parameters $1, $2, etc. for the following
# If -backward is only requested, then the script does a -backward rollback only.
# If -forward is only requested, then the script does a -forward rollback only.
# If both -backward and -forward are specified, then the script does both rollbacks one after the other.
# If neither -backward nor -forward is requested, then the script does a -backward rollback (which is what the caller wants)
#	followed by a hidden -forward rollback after which it verifies that the file header has exactly the same state
#	as the -backward rollback (in terms of sequence numbers etc.).
