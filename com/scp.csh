# It is to handle errors from "scp" by issuing a SCP-E-FAIL error. That way
# a failure to scp is seen as the first failure point in an otherwise complicated test.
# Not having this framework can cause hard to analyze test failures where the
# scp error at the very beginning of the test can be hidden in obscure log files.
