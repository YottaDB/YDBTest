# A MUPIP JOURNAL command that does a SHOW (=ALL, =BROKEN etc.) on multiple regions could display the output
# for the multiple regions in an arbitrary order depending on the env var "gtm_mupjnl_parallel" and arbitrary
# assignments of regions to individual processes. To keep test output deterministic this is a helper awk program
# that sorts the output based on the journal name being showed.
# Note that we use two-dimensional arrays here but do it as out[file, cnt] (instead of out[file][cnt]) as the
# latter syntax is not accepted by gawk 3.x but works in gawk 4.x. The former syntax works in gawk 3.x and 4.x.
