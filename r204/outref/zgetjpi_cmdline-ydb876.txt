# Test that running $ZGETJPI with the keyword CMDLINE gives the command line of process

# Starting background process to get their command lines
# Starting process with small command line
# Starting process with exactly 1024 length command line
# Starting process with more than 1024 length command line

# Now testing $ZGETJPI
# Running with small command line
sh -c sleep 15 && echo '9'
# And the zlength of that output is
26
# Running with exactly 1024 len command line
##TEST_AWKsh -c sleep 15 && echo '[9]{999}'
# And the zlength of that output is
1024
# Running with over 1024 len command line. is exactly length 1025, the cutoff char at the end is a single quote
##TEST_AWKsh -c sleep 15 && echo '[9]{1000}
# And the zlength of that output is
1024
# Running with nonexistent PID -1

# Killing background processes

# Now testing PID=0, this should give the PID of the current YottaDB process

##TEST_AWKSTOP issued to process [0-9]*

# Trying out all PID's to make sure that none produce an error, this will not output anything.


# In this section, we will compile a c program that will edit it's own command line to end with a space
