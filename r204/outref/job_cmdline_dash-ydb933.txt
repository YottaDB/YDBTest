# Test for adding a command line argument with a dash '-' to a job command.
# There used to be a bug where if the first command line argument passed into a job command
# starting with a dash it would produce an error. This should not happen anymore.

# Starting test
# Geting output [cat ydb933.mjo]
job started
-port
# Checking that no error produced by job command [cat ydb933.mje].

# Next test that "$gtm_dist/mumps -dir" has different behavior from a JOBed command.
# "$gtm_dist/mumps -dir -port" should still be an error
# As we decided this MR should not change it's behavior.
# For more details see https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/merge_requests/1792#note_2951733798
# As this should still give an error, we expect a CLIERR error below.
%YDB-E-CLIERR, Unrecognized option : PORT
