# Add a trigger named a1Added SET trigger on ^a named a1
# Attempt to add another trigger named a1. Expect a [trigger named a1 already exists] error.Error : SET trigger on ^a not added as another trigger named a1 already exists
# Verify that t_tries is not 3 at this point by concurrently running [dse crit -seize]
# And trying to run [$ztrigger("select")]# Before YDB@1df7180b0, this would hang. After that, it would run without any hang (expected behavior)
