# Test the fix for reported failure in the overflow/jnlbuffer subtest where a MUUPGRDNRDY message was followed by a %GTM-I-TEXT, Iteration:1, Status Code:76 line in the MUPIP REORG -UPGRADE -REG BREG output. Details at:
# https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/1027#note_2429352656
# 
# Test the fix for a formatting issue with MUPIP REORG -UPGRADE -DBG where global variable names in the output in contain unexpected control characters. Details at:
# https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/1027#note_2427222223
# 

# The below tests force the use of V6 mode to create DBs. This requires turning off ydb_test_4g_db_blks since
# V6 and V7 DBs are incompatible in that V6 cannot allocate unused space beyond the design-maximum total V6 block limit
# in anticipation of a V7 upgrade.

### Test 1: Test fix for 'Status Code:76' in MUPIP REORG -UPGRADE -REG BREG output
# Set version to V6
# Create a V6 database
# Run M routine to set fill many nodes with a long subscript name
# Set version to V7
# Upgrade the global directory
# Run first stage of upgrade process: MUPIP UPGRADE
# Run second stage of upgrade process to produce the error condition: MUPIP REORG -UPGRADE -DBG
# Confirm MUUPGRDNRDY and '%YDB-I-TEXT, Iteration:1, Status Code:76' errors did not occur during MUPIP REORG -UPGRADE.

# such errors would appear in the below output.
