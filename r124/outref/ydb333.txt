# Test that $VIEW("PROBECRIT") has CPT statistic with nanosecond (not microsecond) resolution

# Create database file
# Do : mumps -run ydb333
Do $VIEW("PROBECRIT","DEFAULT") 20 times to see if CPT (nanoseconds) is not a multiple of 1000 at least once
PASS : Found CPT stat that is not a multiple of 1000 proving nanosecond (not microsecond) granularity
# Do dbcheck.csh
