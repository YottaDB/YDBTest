# Test that ZSTEP actions continue to work after a MUPIP INTRPT if $ZINTERRUPT is appropriately set
# Invoke "do ^sstep" in ydb359.m at the beginning so it prints each M line as it executes
# Send a MUPIP INTRPT to self in between
# Expect the M line printing to continue even after the MUPIP INTRPT
# Note: The first M line after MUPIP INTRPT is not displayed. But remaining lines are. Not sure why.
#       But this behavior is the same in GT.M V7.0-001 and YottaDB r2.00.
