# Test that ZSTEP actions continue to work after a MUPIP INTRPT if $ZINTERRUPT is appropriately set
# Invoke "do ^sstep" in ydb359.m at the beginning so it prints each M line as it executes
# Send a MUPIP INTRPT to self in between
# Expect the M line printing to continue even after the MUPIP INTRPT as long as ZSTEP is done inside $ZINTERRUPT code
