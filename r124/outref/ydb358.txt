# Test that ASYNCIO writes in simpleAPI parent and child work fine (no DBIOERR error)

# Create ASYNCIO=ON database
Database file ##TEST_PATH##/mumps.dat now has asyncio enabled

# Verify flush timer is 1 second (ydb358.c relies on this when it waits for 2 seconds)
  Cache freeze id                0x00000000  Flush timer            00:00:01:00

# Compiling/Linking ydb358.c into executable ydb358 and executing it
Parent pid : Set ^parent=<parentpid> with ydb_set_s()
Parent pid : Sleep 2 seconds so flush timer will do AIO writes to DB
Parent pid : Fork child after parent has done AIO writes
Parent pid : Waiting for child to terminate
Child pid : Set ^child=<childpid> with ydb_set_s()
Child pid : Sleep 2 seconds so flush timer in child will do AIO writes to DB
Child pid : Halting
Parent pid : Halting
ydb358 returned with exit status : 0
