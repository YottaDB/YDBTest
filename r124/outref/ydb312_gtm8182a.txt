# Unset gtm_custom_error if it exists as ydb312_gtm8182a relies on this

# run updateINST3^ydb312gtm8182a.m to write variable to INST3 DB to read later

# Reset gtm_custom_error if it was unset


# run ydb312gtm8182a.m to:
#  	-update INST1
#  	-read from INST3
#  	-show attached processes of each INST JNLPOOL (SRC server will be 1 of these processes)
# We expect 2 processes attached to INST1 JNLPOOL and only 1 process attached to INST3 JNLPOOL.
# To confirm that the mumps process only attaches to INST1 JNLPOOL.

    Update the INST1 DB
    Read from INST3 DB

    number of processes attached to JNLPOOL of INST1: 2
    number of processes attached to JNLPOOL of INST3: 1
