# Test that VIEW "NOISOLATION" optimization affects atomicity of $INCREMENT inside TSTART/TCOMMIT
# In the below test, ^x is updated using $INCREMENT inside a TSTART/TCOMMIT by multiple processes
# Case (1) : Without VIEW "NOISOLATION", the transaction will restart due to a concurrent $INCREMENT
#     This means the final value of ^x would be exactly the # of transactions that committed
# Case (2) : But with VIEW "NOISOLATION", the user gives a guarantee that nodes updates by one process are not
#     updated by the same process. Therefore the transaction is not restarted in case of a concurrent
#     $INCREMENT thus resulting in the final value of ^x being way different from what it was in Case (1)

ISOLATION : PASS : ^x is equal to (^max*^njobs)/2 as expected

# In NOISOLATION case, if access method is BG, we expect ^x to be NOT equal to (^max*^njobs)/2.
# In NOISOLATION case, if access method is MM, we expect ^x to be equal to (^max*^njobs)/2.
# See https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/merge_requests/1166#note_951687754 for more details.
# Therefore, the checks are different based on the access method.
