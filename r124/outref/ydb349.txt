# Test that MUPIP REORG on database file with non-zero RESERVED_BYTES does not cause integrity errors

# Create database file with 4Kb block_size and record_size
# Set a single node in database that can randomly occupy upto one GDS block of space
# Set reserved_bytes on database to a random value from 0 to 4012 (maximum reserved bytes for 4Kb block_size)
# Run MUPIP REORG with a random fill factor ranging from 0% to 100%
# Before #349 code fixes, this would fail with cores and/or produce DBINVGBL integrity errors
# Do dbcheck.csh
