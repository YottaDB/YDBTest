	; The ntestin executable is a c program which echoes back input to stdout.  It is run here in order to test
	; the "independent" deviceparameter.  The ntestin executable is designed to run after the pipe is closed.
	; This test will save the process id of this executable to be killed by the test script after this m
	; routine has run.
	;
	; This convolution for the ps command is due to the differences with Alpine Linux. Fortunately, what we need to
	; there and for glibc based Linux distros is the same.
