# This test opens the help database (using PEEKBYNAME) and since other concurrent tests could also be doing
# PEEKBYNAME concurrently, we want to avoid semaphore counter overflow to affect this or the concurrent test.
# Therefore disable counter overflow in this test by setting the increment value to default value of 1 (aka unset).
