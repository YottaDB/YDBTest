				     # messes up the whitebox test case
# With 16K counter semaphore bump per process, the 32K counter overflow happens with two mumps processes
# that this test starts and so the white-box code in db_init which is exercised by the later TWO dse invocations
# does not see the counter at 3 or 4 like it expects and defeats the purpose of the test. It is not easy to
# design the white-box code to work with a 16K counter semaphore bump so prevent counter overflow by setting
# the increment value to default value of 1 (aka unset).
