# This test verifies a Go main can catch/recover from a SIGSEGV signal/panic once the YottaDB environment
# has been initialized. Prior to YDB r1.30 and Go wrapper v1.1.0, this was not possible.
# Building sigsegv
# Running sigsegv
Successful panic recovery! Panic message: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
