****** Part 2 - parameter testing

# Running Go program
**Test we can pass various types of read-only parms either by value or by reference
* First test integer types first by value then by reference
* Next unsigned integer tests
* Next bool testes
* Next float32 tests
* Next float64 tests
* Validate we get a "not equal" message when passing different values from tests above (3 tests)
Expecting parm1/parm2 to be equal but they were not - parm1: -42  parm2: -3.1415925
Expecting parm1/parm2 to be equal but they were not - parm1: -3.1415925  parm2: 3.141592653589793
Expecting parm1/parm2 to be equal but they were not - parm1: 3.141592653589793  parm2: -42

**Testing update parms - IO, I, O where 1st & 3rd parms are updated with ALL passed by reference
**Testing update parms - IO, I, O where 1st & 3rd parms are updated with parm2 passed by value
**Testing passing max number of parms (32)

**Testing error - putting pass-by-value in update parm (expecting panic)
Recovered from panic: Call-in routine Update2Parms parm 1 is an output parm and must be *string but is not
**Testing error - putting non string type (*int) in update parm (expecting panic)
Recovered from panic: Call-in routine Update2Parms parm 1 is an output parm and must be *string but is not
**Testing error - putting non string type (*float32) in update parm (expecting panic)
Recovered from panic: Call-in routine Update2Parms parm 3 is an output parm and must be *string but is not
**Testing error - Passing too many parms (more than 32)
Recovered from panic: YDB: parm count of 33 exceeds maximum parm count of 32
