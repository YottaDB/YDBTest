# Test to purposely create a deadlock by creating a TP transaction and then inside it doing a GET type call
# but using yottadb.NOTTP as the tptoken instead of the tptoken created for us and passed into the callback
# routine. Prior to a late fix to YDB#561, this was working anyway so this test is to make sure that does NOT
# happen anymore. In the future, when we add a deadlock detector, this test should morph into a test for that
# support.
# Running : go get -d -v -x -t lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb
# Building deadlock
# Running deadlock
 --> Process did not terminate just like it was expected to
# Sending : [kill -9] to backgrounded SimpleAPI application to terminate it
