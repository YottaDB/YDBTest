# This test verifies that, using the SimpleThreadAPI (via Go), if a TP restart is induced via a SimpleThreadAPI
# call, it returns YDB_TP_RESTART (error text is a fast-path 'TPRESTART'). But we also want this return code if,
# in the transaction callback routine, some M code is driven which causes a TP restart. Prior to YDB#619, this
# flavor returned TPRETRY instead.
