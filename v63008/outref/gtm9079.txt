# In V6.3-007, a failed zcompile call within a nested xecute will produce an incorrect error
code. This issue was fixed in V6.3-008. This tests for whether the error code produced
by attempting to zcompile a file, gtm9079A.m, that does not compile, within
a xecute statement produces an incorrect error code.
# Verifying that the error code produced by zcompile when called within xecute
on a file that does not compile is correct.
