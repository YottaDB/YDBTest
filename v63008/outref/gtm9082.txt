# In V6.3-007, auto-upgrading the database file headers would not set the
# flush_trigger_top field properly and would be set to 0 instead of the current flush_trigger value. This test verifies that
# the flush_triger_top field is correctly auto-upgraded (i.e. does not require MUPIP -SET TRIGGER_FLUSH to fix)
# Creating a database to a version prior to V63007
# Checking the current value of Flush trigger
Flush trigger                  960
# Switching back to current version
# Verifying that the file header has been automatically upgraded by
# checking that flush_trigger_top is set to 960
