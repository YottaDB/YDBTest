# The $translate command returns a string that results from replacing or dropping characters in the first of its arguments as specified by the pattern of its other arguments. In V6.3-006 and V6.3-007, it could cause a seg11 if a previous call to $translate had been passed an undefined argument.
# Verifying that "$translate" does not sig11
# Should run for 15 seconds
