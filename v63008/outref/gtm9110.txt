# In GT.M versions V6.3-008 and later when entering a shell
# command line longer than 32KiB GT.M will issue an error of
# either CLIERR or CLISTRTOOLONG. In V6.3-007 a regression
# allowed this condition to cause a segmentation violation(SIG-11)
# We attempted to produce the CLIERR but we were not able to reproduce
# the error in our test
# Verifying that a shell command line over 32KiB reports a CLISTRTOOLONG
# Checking for CLISTRTOOLONG(in v63007 a segmentation fault occurs)
%YDB-E-CLIERR, Command line too long (33023 maximum)
