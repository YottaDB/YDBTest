# Test that local array performance does not deteriorate exponentially with large # of nodes
# We first run the test with a small number of nodes.
# Then double it and expect the test to run approximately twice as long.
#	We allow the test to run 3 times as long. Anything longer is considered a failure.
# We double it once more and do the same time verification.
# If stpg_sort algorithm is O(n^2), the time taken for double the input size would be 4x.
# Having the threshold as 3x, we expect to catch the O(n^2) algorithm in stpg_sort.
# With a O(nlogn) algorithm in stpg_sort, we expect almost linear growth (i.e. 2x to 3x output for 2x input).
