# Name-level $ORDER(,-1) and $ZPREVIOUS() return an empty string when they reach the trigger definitions (stored in ^#t) as it is not a normally accessible global
# Since the introduction of triggers in V5.4-000 if there were trigger definitions, these functions could return ^#t

# This does not sucessfully test the above release note as this simple case does not reproduce the issue
