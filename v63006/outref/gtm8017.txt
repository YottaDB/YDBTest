# The ^%TRIM() utility allows the specification of what character(s) to trim from either the left and/or right hand side of a given string
# The default trim characters are $CHAR(32,9) (<SP> and <TAB>), these can be overridden by passing a string consisting of the desired characters in the optional second parameter.This functionality has existed for some time but was undocumented and not regularly tested

# Testing $$FUNC^%TRIM varients of %TRIM
Testing default behavior of %TRIM (trimming <TAB> <SP>)
