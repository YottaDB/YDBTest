; Test for GTM-8793 - Test we get new EXITSTATUS error when script defined by ydb_procstuckexec is driven and returns non-zero code
;
; Test methodology:
;
;    1. Create database, initialize $ydb_procstuckexec to drive 'noexistPSE.csh' (a non-existent script)
;    2. Start a DSE session in a pipe so we can control what happens.
;    3. In the DSE session do a 'crit -seize' command.
;    4. Drive '$ydb_dist/yottadb -run ^%XCMD "set ^x=1" in a pipe.
;    5. Wait 30 seconds, and the procstuckexec should fire when the MUTEXLCKALERT occurs then wait 60 more seconds
;       for slow and/or loaded systems to react to the timeout.
;    6. Verify the EXITSTATUS error was sent to syslog from thejobbed off process.
;    7. Stop the sub-processes and wait them to go away before exiting.
