# Test that VIEW "NOISOLATION" optimization affects non-TP transactions like it does TP transactions.
# In the below test, ^x(n) is incremented by each of the 5 processes (for 5000 times each). All of the
# counters live in the same data block. We expect that ISOLATION runs will have type 13 restarts while
# NOISOLATION runs will have type 14 restarts (restart type t_blkmod_t_end3 vs t_blkmod_t_end4).
