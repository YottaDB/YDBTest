# mprndwnnoarg: Test argumentless mupip rundown behavior.
#		If there are TWO shared memory segments both of which point to the SAME db file name,
#		and one of them is actively being used, argumentless mupip rundown should clean up
#		the shared memory segment that no longer corresponds back to the db file name
