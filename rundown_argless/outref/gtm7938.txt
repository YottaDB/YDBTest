Instance INSTANCE1 crashed!
# Switch to the current version now
# Taking away write permissions from mumps.repl so that we get an additional error after the version mismatch error
# MUPIP RUNDOWN will generate two errors: A version mismatch error followed by a file permission error (when trying to write to mumps.repl)
# This should not crash with SIGSEGV
# The test is over. Give the write permissions back
# Switch to the older version so that we can shutdown receiver
