# This test was originally written to test ZTP but with V63002, this fails asserts.
# Since ZTP is no longer supported, this test is now changed to use TP (instead of ZTP).
#
# Below is original comment
#	C9C01-001878 GTM fails for multi-process journaling test with ZTS/ZTC
#	Subtest makes sense only when run with TP as it tests some features of ZTP/ZTC.
