"Simple Example" (Section 6.1.2.1) from the design spec.

Details:
--------------
Let us take a simple example of three instances A, B, C with the following sequence of events. The symbol (P) below
denotes that instance was primary in that step.  The symbol (S) below denotes that instance was a secondary in that
step.  The symbol X below denotes that instance crashed in that step.  The notation 1-100 below implies the seqno
range from 1 to 100 both inclusive.
           |--> INST2 (B)
INST1 (A) -|
           |--> INST3 (C)

        ---------------------------------------------
                 INST1/A     INST2/B     INST3/C
        ---------------------------------------------
Step 1:        (P) 1-100   (S) 1-80    (S)  1-70
Step 2:             X           X      (P) 71-120
