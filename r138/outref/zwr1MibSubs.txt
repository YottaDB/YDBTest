# Test that ZWRITE of lvn with 1MiB subscript works fine
# Before YDB@5e955190, this used to assert fail in sr_port/lvzwr_out.c
# Run [yottadb -run zwr1MibSubs]. This would create a file [zwr.txt] with the ZWRITE output
# The file [zwr.txt] would have 33 lines, the first 32 lines being 32767 bytes long and the last line being 42 bytes long
# Extract first 42 columns of ALL lines to confirm ZWRITE command worked fine
