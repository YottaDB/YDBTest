# 1. Allow extract if db file is not available (previously failed with %YDB-W-DBCOLLREQ)
# 2. Long records are ingested correctly (previously failed with an LVUNDEF error)
# 3. Transaction records are ingested correctly (previously failed with %YDBJNLF-F-BADRECTYPE)

# Creating unjournaled database
Files Created in ##TEST_PATH##:

# Adding ability to add long data
Database file ##TEST_PATH##/mumps.dat now has maximum record size 1000000
Database file ##TEST_PATH##/mumps.dat now has 65536 global buffers

# Turning on journaling
%YDB-I-JNLCREATE, Journal file ##TEST_PATH##/myjournal.mjl created for region DEFAULT with NOBEFORE_IMAGES
