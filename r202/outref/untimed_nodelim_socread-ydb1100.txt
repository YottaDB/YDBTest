# Test untimed nodelimiter socket READs return sooner than r2.00
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Parent process jobs off a child process and communicates with child through a socket
# The socket is opened with NODELIM
# Child process does 256 WRITE commands each of which write small pieces of text
# Before the YDB#1100 fixes, all 256 write command outputs would be read by ONE untimed READ command
# (as it would wait for all data to be available before terminating the READ command).
# Whereas after the YDB#1100 fixes, an untimed READ with NODELIM returns whenever SOME data is available
# We therefore expect the parent process to read the 256 WRITE command data in MULTIPLE untimed READ commands
PASS: Parent read all 256 pieces of data from child exactly as expected
PASS: Parent used at least 2 READ commands (as expected)
