# This is to test the frequency at which the source server log file emits output.
# Create a new empty database so we can run an M program.
# Run 50000 transactions and make sure exactly 5 logs are emitted.
# Validate that the sequence numbers in REPL INFO messages are 10000 transactions apart.
# On ARM, these numbers have been observed to vary between 1 and 100 of the expected value.
# Permit a variance of up to 500, as long as we don't see more logs than we expect.
