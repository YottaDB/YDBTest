# > While trying this test case out with upstream releases (GT.M

# This is an automated test of the test case described at
# https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/960#description.
# The output expected below is g="^a(2,1)".
# Before YDB#960, one used to instead see a GVUNDEF error.
g="^a(2,1)"
