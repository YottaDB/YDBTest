# This comment explains a regression:
# https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/780#note_1937891232
#
# > While trying to identify all scenarios which need
# > documentation (see https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDBTest/-/merge_requests/2007#note_1937772663
# > for details on one scenario that was found as lacking
# > documentation), I noticed a regression in GT.M V7.0-000.
# >
# > https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/basicops.html#configuring-the-restriction-facility
# > says the following.
# >
# >> If the file exists, a process that has:
# >> * write authorization to restrict.txt has no restrictions;
# >
# > And this was true in GT.M V6.3-014, but it is not in
# > GT.M V7.0-000.

# permission, considered as syntax error, and all features are
# disabled.
