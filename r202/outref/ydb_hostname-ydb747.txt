# Test 1: Set ydb_hostname to TESTHOSTNAME
# Expected output of node_local.machine_name in database file header to be TESTHOSTNAME
TESTHOSTNAME

# Test 2: Set ydb_hostname length=255 (Maximum hostname length - 1)
# Expected output of node_local.machine_name in database file header to be ##255-byte-long-hostname##

# Test 3: Set ydb_hostname length=256 (Maximum hostname length)
# Expect node_local.machine_name in database file header to truncate at 255, as that is the behavior of strncpy().
# So it should output the same thing as the Test #2 (##255-byte-long-hostname##).
