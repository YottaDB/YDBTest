# Most of this test was based on the v63003/gtm4212 test which checks for
# a FILENAMETOOLONG error for temp file paths that are >= 255 characters.
# The gtm9182 issue was similar to this one but subtly different as the
# bug here was that the error wasn't returned immediately if the temp
# file's path was < 255 characters but the backup file's path was
# > 255 characters. The gtm9182 changes only fixed this for backups
# where a backup filename not a directory was specified. The YDB#864
# changes address issues with backups incorrectly succeeding where a
# directory is specified. This test covers both of these cases.

# As the length of the temp file, including the trailing / is 24 (an example
# is DEFAULT_0000c4be_XXXXXX where the 0000c4be part is randomly generated)
# and the length of a database called 'mumps', including '.dat' and the
# trailing / is 10, we create a database called 'mumpsmumpsmumpsmumpsm' so that
# it will be 26 characters long, 2 character longer than the temp file path.
# This is 2 characters longer than the temp file path because a directory
# path + temp file of exactly 255 characters produces an error but a backup
# file path of exactly 255 characters works fine. An attempt to modify the
# GTM-4212 changes to allow a path + temp file of exactly 255 resulted in
# a %SYSTEM-E-ENO22 error when the MKSTEMP() macro attempted to create the
# temp file. Hence the database file name must be at least 2 characters
# longer than the temp file to produce an error that we wouldn't see with
# just the GTM-4212 changes. We also disable journaling on this database.
# This is necessary because the journals would sometimes fill up, producing
# test failures due to YDB-I-JNLCREATE and YDB-I-FILERENAME messages
