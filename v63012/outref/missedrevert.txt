# This tests for SIG-11s caused by missed REVERTs in m_for.c.
# While merging V6.3-012, we had an issue due to a missed REVERT
# in sr_port/m_for.c. This test checks that a FOR works correctly
# and does not crash with a SIG-11. See
# https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/merge_requests/1132#note_896366838
