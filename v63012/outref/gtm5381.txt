# Test to verify that the -FULLBLKWRT setting works correctly in all three modes {0,1,2} both with
# MUPIP and GDE.
#
# This test uses strace to capture the system calls done by a process doing a simple database
# update and verifies the correct functioning of each of the 3 modes:
#   0 - disabled
#   1 - enabled - writes occur on filesystem block boundaries
#   2 - enabled - Like (1) plus also writes full database blocks if it is the first time blk is written
# The straces are processed to find the largest database write done in the strace file and reports
# this value - which changes with each FULLBLKWRT setting.

# Create a DB with blksize 8192
Files Created in ##TEST_PATH##:
Using: ##SOURCE_PATH##/mumps -run GDE
mumps.gld
Using: ##SOURCE_PATH##/mupip
mumps.dat

# Test that we can use GDE to initialize the DB to fullblkwrt=2 - other flavors will use MUPIP SET
# to effect the change in fullblkwrt settings. Also recreate mumps.dat with new gld file

# Verify if GDE SHOW output contains the correct fullblockwrite indicator
FBWR value from 'GDE SHOW' input file (gdeshow.txt) is 2

# Make a copy of this database as we need to refresh out DB between each strace invocation.

# For each of the valid FULLBLKWRT settings, run strace on a yottadb invocation that (1) sets a new node
# (^x in this case), (2) flushes the DB to see the writes done for that, then (3) increments the node it
# just set. In FULLBLKWRT=2, this will show that the first SET wrote 2 blocks with 8K writes (new ^x index
# block and the data block), then the next time that datablock gets updated, a 4K write is used. The other
# two modes do not show a difference.

### Starting test for -FULLBLKWRT=2 [enabled dbblock] - Expect 3 4K writes and 2 8K writes
# Verify if DSE D -F output contains the correct full block write mode
FBWR value from 'DSE D -F' input file (dsedf2.txt) is         2

List of write sizes and their counts for strace file strace02.logx
   Write Length   Count
           4096       3
           8192       2

### Starting test for -FULLBLKWRT=1 [enabled filblock] - Expect 5 4K writes
Database file ##TEST_PATH##/mumps.dat now has full blk writes: file system block writes
# Verify if DSE D -F output contains the correct full block write mode
FBWR value from 'DSE D -F' input file (dsedf1.txt) is         1

### Starting test for -FULLBLKWRT=0 [disabled] - Expect multiple write sizes < 200 bytes
Database file ##TEST_PATH##/mumps.dat now has full blk writes: disabled
# Verify if DSE D -F output contains the correct full block write mode
FBWR value from 'DSE D -F' input file (dsedf0.txt) is         0
