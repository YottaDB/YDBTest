# Test to verify when the source server has a name resolution failure, it gives more information (specifically
# the node name) and is more persistent about retrying the resolution until it succeeds or is stopped.

# Set up half of a replicated environment. We won't really use the other side as this issue is tested when the
# configuration is rather borked since we are attempting to connect to a bogus host.

# Obtain a usable port number

# Now, start up a replication source server to a node that does not exist. We should continue to run until we
# stop it and the name should show up in the messages. Also set reconnect attempt duration to 2 seconds to
# drop the number of retries per second to avoid flooding source server log. Note while we use -CONNECTPARAMS
# option to make the source log smaller by increasing the time periods for hard retries as well as making the
# soft retry shorter so we test generate some of the messages that were incorrect, we do not have a good way
# of validating them. See discussion of this at https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDBTest/-/merge_requests/1412#note_991497600
