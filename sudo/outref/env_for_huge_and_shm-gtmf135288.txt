#
# Release note http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-005_Release_Notes.html#GTM-F135288 says:
#
# > When the gtm_pinshm environment variable is defined and
# > evaluates to a non-zero integer or any case-independent
# > string or leading substring of TRUE or YES in a process
# > creating shared memory, GT.M attempts to pin such memory
# > used for database global buffers, replication buffers,
# > and routine buffers into physical memory. Huge pages are
# > implicitly locked in physical memory, so GT.M does not attempt
# > to pin shared memory buffers backed by huge pages. gtm_pinshm
# > does not pin memory used by online INTEG (integ snapshot).
# > Pinning  may not succeed due to insufficient physical memory
# > and/or OS configuration. When the gtm_hugetlb_shm environment
# > variable is defined and evaluates to a non-zero integer or any
# > case-independent string or leading substring of TRUE or YES
# > in a process creating shared memory, GT.M attempts to back all
# > such shared memory segments with huge pages, using the default
# > huge page size. If huge pages cannot be used, GT.M tries to
# > back the shared memory with base pages instead, and attempts to
# > pin the shared memory if requested with gtm_pinshm. GT.M issues
# > a SHMHUGETLB or SHMLOCK warning message to the system log when
# > the system is unable to back shared memory with huge pages or
# > is unable to pin shared memory to physical memory, respectively.
# > Previously, GT.M did not support the gtm_pinshm option to pin
# > memory, and gtm_hugetlb_shm replaces the use of libhugetlbfs
# > for huge page functions, so GT.M no longer evaluates
# > libhugetlbfs environment variables, e.g. HUGETLB_SHM,
# > HUGETLB_VERBOSE, etc. [Linux] (GTM-F135288)
