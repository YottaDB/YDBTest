# Since this test does not care about M vs UTF-8 mode, wwitch test to M mode for ease of implementation.

# Prepare script gtmtest1_execute.csh to be executed by gtmtest1 userid
# Execute script gtmtest1_execute.csh as userid gtmtest1
# This will open $gtm_dist/gtmhelp.dat and then kill -9 itself leaving the ftok semaphore lying around

# Start $gtm_dist/gtmsecshr after setting ydb_tmp/gtm_tmp to /tmp/tmp.xxxx (where xxxx is a randomly generated name)
# Unset ydb_tmp/gtm_tmp env var
# Open $gtm_dist/gtmhelp.dat as current userid
# This would need help from gtmsecshr server to remove the ftok semaphore when it terminates
# But this process has ydb_tmp/gtm_tmp unset, whereas gtmsecshr server started in the previous step has it set.
# We therefore expect this process to be unable to communicate with the server and end up with a GTMSECSHRSRVF error
# We also expect to see various other secondary errors CRITSEMFAIL/ENO2 etc.
