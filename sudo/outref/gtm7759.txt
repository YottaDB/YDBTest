# Test for GTM-7759 - verify that the new (V63012) LOGDENIALS statement in restrict.txt works correctly.
#
# This test runs a series of 3 small tests on two userids. The two userids are (1) the user this test was
# started with and the second is a userid we create (and remove) in this test - ydbtest3. We use 'sudo su'
# to switch users and record the log of what the test did. The test makes a copy of the YottaDB distro so
# we can add the restrict.txt file to it. This file contains only a LOGDENIALS statement for group ydbtest3
# so our expectation is that on runs in the ydbtest3 userid, it will see the error we are testing in the
# syslog file while runs with the test userid will not see those errors logged. There are a lot of errors
# which have their messages designated as automatically being logged to syslog. We only test 3 as most of
# them are significantly difficult to invoke.
