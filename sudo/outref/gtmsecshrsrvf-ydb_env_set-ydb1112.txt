# Test ydb_env_set calls in a multi-user environment do not result in GTMSECSHRSRVF errors

# This test runs commands as current user and gtmtest1 userid. The latter is not easy to do in UTF-8 mode.
# Since this test does not care about M vs UTF-8 mode, wwitch test to M mode for ease of implementation.
setenv gtm_chset M
unset echo
# Prepare script gtmtest1_execute.csh to be executed by gtmtest1 userid
# Execute script gtmtest1_execute.csh as userid gtmtest1
# This will open $gtm_dist/gtmhelp.dat and then kill -9 itself leaving the ftok semaphore lying around
Killed
# Start $gtm_dist/gtmsecshr after setting ydb_tmp/gtm_tmp to something like /tmp/yottadb/r2.02_x86_64
# (which matches what ydb_env_set would have set the env var to)
# Open $gtm_dist/gtmhelp.dat as current userid using $gtm_dist/ydb_env_set (which does PEEKBYNAME calls)
# This would need help from gtmsecshr server to remove the ftok semaphore when it terminates
# But this process has ydb_tmp/gtm_tmp unset, whereas gtmsecshr server started in the previous step has it set.
# We expect the ydb_env_set call to set ydb_tmp to the appropriate value and successfully communicate with the server.
# And NOT end up with a GTMSECSHRSRVF error which it did before the YDB#1112 code fixes.
# We expect to see NO errors from the ydb_env_set invocation.
