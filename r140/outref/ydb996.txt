# Test M program to demonstrate passing a LISTENing TCP socket to a child through a LOCAL socket
# -----------------------
# Open LISTENING TCP socket and give it a name [handle1]
# Move LISTENING TCP socket [handle1] to socketpool device
# JOB off child to pass the LISTENING TCP socket
# Open new LISTENING LOCAL socket file named [socket2] and give it a handle name [handle2]
# Wait for connection from child on socket [socket2]
# Pass the LISTENING TCP socket through [socket2]
# Connect to LISTENING TCP socket that has been passed to child
# Read data writen by child process from the connected TCP socket
# Display data, written by child, in the parent process
# Expect to see 5 lines of data and an empty 6th line
