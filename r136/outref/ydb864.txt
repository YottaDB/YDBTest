# This test runs MUPIP BACKUPs with backup directory paths from
# 220 to 265 characters where there are 2 database files with
# separate names, regions and segments. The backups are run with
# and without the -noonline option. The expected result is for
# paths of 255 or less to work but for paths of more than 255
# to result in errors.

# Starting the online MUPIP BACKUPs. For these, we generate
# directory paths of 220 to 266 characters including the
# length of the test directory. The test directory is included
# in the length for these backups because online backups use the
# full directory path for the temporary file. This means that a
# backup directory length of even 220 would always generate an
# error if run from the test directory. Setting the minimum of
# the range to a lower number wouldn't work because the length of
# the test directory can vary based on factors such as the build
# name and which user is running the test which would make it
# impossible to predict where the FILENAMETOOLONG errors should
# first show up. So we subtract the length of the test dir from
# the directory length to ensure predictable results in this
# section of the test. We expect a path, including the test
# of 230 or more characters to produce a FILENAMETOOLONG error
