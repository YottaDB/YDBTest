# Automated test case for test.csh/helper.csh in https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/872#description
# Create an empty M program tmp.m in current directory
# Set gtmroutines env var to use auto-relink on current directory
# Fire off 16 background jobs each of which start lots of short-lived YottaDB processes that in turn open/close relinkctl file
# Wait for all background jobs to finish
# Check for any errors (done by test framework). Should see no output below.
