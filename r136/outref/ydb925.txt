# Regression test for parsing incompletly specified Z* ISV, functions and commands
# This test specifies various commands that are part of other M implementations 
#  but are not implemented by YottaDB. Its only function is to act as a canary to tell
#  us if the expression parser changes.

# A compilation is done; and there is not supposed to be any output below.
# The previous output was:
# -- %YDB-E-INVSVN, Invalid special variable name
# -- %YDB-E-FNOTONSYS, Function or special variable is not supported by this operating system
# -- %YDB-E-INVFCN, Invalid function name
# -- %YDB-E-INVCMD, Invalid command keyword encountered
