# Test that no %YDB-E-TPFAIL error (eeee) when cnl->tp_hint is almost 2GiB
# This test is based on https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/944#note_1152977733
# Start gdb so we can set cnl->tp_hint = 0x7ffffffe and then run ydb944.m
(gdb) (gdb) $1 = 0x7ffffffe
# Entered ydb944.m. At this point, cnl->tp_hint would be 0x7ffffffe (2 short of 2GiB)
# Now run 100 TP transactions that each allocate a new block
# Before the YDB#944 fixes, cnl->tp_hint would reach 2GiB and we would get a TPFAIL error (eeee)
# After the YDB#944 fixes, cnl->tp_hint would be reset to an actual block number so will not reach 2GiB
# And therefore, we would not get any error (which is what we expect to see below)
# Run dbcheck.csh
