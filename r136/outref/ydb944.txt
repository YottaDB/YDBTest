# Test that no %YDB-E-TPFAIL error (eeee) when cnl->tp_hint is almost 2**31 (for V6) or 2**63 (V7)
# This test is based on https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/944#note_1152977733
# Start gdb so we can set cnl->tp_hint = 0x7ffffffe (for V6) or 0x7ffffffffffffffe (for V7) and then run ydb944.m
# Entered ydb944.m. At this point, cnl->tp_hint would be 0x7ffffffe (2 short of 2**31 if V6 == 4-byte db block)
# OR 0x7ffffffffffffffe (2 short of 2**63 if V7 == 8-byte db block)
# Now run 100 TP transactions that each allocate a new block
#
# Before the YDB#944 fixes, cnl->tp_hint would reach 2**31 and we would get a TPFAIL error (eeee)
# After the YDB#944 fixes, cnl->tp_hint would be reset to an actual block number so will not reach 2**31
#
# Before the GTM-DE345399 fixes (e.g. GT.M V7.0-004), cnl->tp_hint would reach 2**63 and we would get an
# assert failure in a Debug GT.M build
# After the GTM-DE345399 fixes (e.g. GT.M V7.0-005), cnl->tp_hint would reach 2**63 and would be reset to
# an actual block number so will not reach 2**63
#
# That is, we do not expect to see any error below
#
# Run dbcheck.csh
