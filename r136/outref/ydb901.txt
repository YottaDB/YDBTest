# SIG-11 when compiling with -NOLINE_ENTRY if M code contains a BREAK or NEW
# This test runs multiple samples that previously crashed if compiled with -noline_entry
# When it runs now, no output is expected, which is what we want
# BREAK No label, first line code
# BREAK First line label no code, second line code
# BREAK First line label followed by M code
# BREAK First line comment, M code eventually follows after comments
# BREAK First line empty, code follows
# BREAK Use one local variable BEFORE the BREAK followed by a local variable reference in the next line
