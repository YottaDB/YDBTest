# This test ensures that YottaDB does not zlink an M file only if the timestamp of the corresponding object file is at least a nanosecond older
# Create a simple M routine test.m
# Compile the M routine.
# Compile the helper program stat.c
--------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1. Object is more than a second older than source (test.o, a).
--------------------------------------------------------------
# Make sure that a recompile happens if the source's and object's timestamps are more than a second apart.
hello, world!
test.o
a
--------------------------------------------------------------
Test 2. Object is slightly older than source (test.o, b).
--------------------------------------------------------------
# Make sure that a recompile happens if the source's and object's timestamps are within the same second, but at least one nanosecond apart.
hello, world!
test.o
b
--------------------------------------------------------------
Test 3. Object and source have the same timestamp (c, test.o).
--------------------------------------------------------------
# Make sure that a recompile happens even if the source's and object's timestamps match to the nanosecond.
hello, world!
test.o
c
