# GTM-9331 - Fixes issue when timer pops during an external call and that external call has its own signal
#            handling so the SIGALRM that pops to drive the timer handler gets handled by a different
#            handler so (in this tests case) the $ZTIMEOUT never pops. This test actually tests this code
#	           two ways:
#              1. With the external call defined WITH the SIGSAFE keyword indicating it does no signal handling
#	                (which it actually does do).
#	             2. With the external call NOT defined with the SIGSAFE keyword.
#
#            Additionally, this test also run a test developed while developing the first test that demonstrates
#            that the SIGSAFE attribute in the external call table works appropriately.

# Building call-in library and external call table

# Drive gtm9331a test routine (tests issue with $ZTIMEOUT)
# GTM-9331 - Verify that an external call driven while a timer is set and if that external call
#            messes with signal handling causing the timer expire to occur and be ignored since
#            it was not handled with the GTM/YottaDB timer handler.
#
#            This test uses $ZTIMEOUT as an easily settable timer that while it is running, we
#            can go off and do other things. Such things are more difficult with things like
#            the HANG command where we don't get control again until the HANG is complete.

# First test using external call sigwait1() which has SIGSAFE defined on the external call (expect lost timer wakeup)
signalWait: Handler reset - starting sleep for max 10 seconds
ignoreSig: Signal popped - in handler
signalWait: Sleep complete - sig caught flag: 1
The external call saw the timer pop
The $ZTIMEOUT was not recognized or driven - lost timer wakeup

# Second test using external call sigwait2() which does NOT have SIGSAFE defined on the external call
signalWait: Handler reset - starting sleep for max 10 seconds
ignoreSig: Signal popped - in handler
signalWait: Sleep complete - sig caught flag: 1
*** $ZTIMEOUT popped (in $ZTIMEOUT routine)
The external call saw the timer pop
The $ZTIMEOUT fired correctly!!

# Drive gtm9331b test routine (uses HANG to test SIGSAFE flag)
# GTM-9331 - This routine is not really a test of GTM9331 but is a test that was created while
#            trying to test GTM9331. It is largely a test of the SIGSAFE keyword in the external
#            call table. In this test, what we do first is drive the external call that does NOT
#            have the SIGSAFE keyword first as it should notice the handler was changed and fix
#            it but the second call drives the SIGSAFE keyword so doing that does not check that
#            the SIGALRM handler has been changed so the subsequent HANG actually stays HUNG
#            until the process gets shot.

# First test using external call sigdisable2() which does NOT have SIGSAFE defined on the external call (expect success)
##TEST_AWKHang time was 5[0-9]{6}us \(5 seconds\)

# Second test using external call sigdisable1() which has SIGSAFE defined on the external call (expect HANG command to hang until killed on GT.M, pass on YottaDB)
##TEST_AWKHang time was 5[0-9]{6}us \(5 seconds\)
