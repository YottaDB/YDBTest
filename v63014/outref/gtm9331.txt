# GTM-9331 - Fixes issue when timer pops during an external call and that external call has its own signal
#            handling so the SIGALRM that pops to drive the timer handler gets handled by a different
#            handler so (in this tests case) the $ZTIMEOUT never pops. This test actually tests this code
#	           two ways:
#              1. With the external call defined WITH the SIGSAFE keyword indicating it does no signal handling
#	                (which it actually does do).
#	             2. With the external call NOT defined with the SIGSAFE keyword.

# Building call-in library and external call table
# (note there are two external calls that call the same routine but one has SIGSAFE declared and the other does not

# Drive gtm9331 test routine (tests issue with $ZTIMEOUT)
# GTM-9331 - Verify that an external call driven while a timer is set and if that external call
#            messes with signal handling causing the timer expire to occur and be ignored since
#            it was not handled with the GTM/YottaDB timer handler.
#
#            This test uses $ZTIMEOUT as an easily settable timer that while it is running, we
#            can go off and do other things. Such things are more difficult with things like
#            the HANG command where we don't get control again until the HANG is complete.

# First test using external call sigwait1() which has SIGSAFE defined on the external call (expect lost timer wakeup)
signalWait: Handler reset - starting sleep for max 10 seconds
ignoreSig: Signal popped - in handler
signalWait: Sleep complete - sig caught flag: 1
The external call saw the timer pop
The $ZTIMEOUT was not recognized or driven - lost timer wakeup

# Second test using external call sigwait2() which does NOT have SIGSAFE defined on the external call
signalWait: Handler reset - starting sleep for max 10 seconds
ignoreSig: Signal popped - in handler
signalWait: Sleep complete - sig caught flag: 1
*** $ZTIMEOUT popped (in $ZTIMEOUT routine)
The external call saw the timer pop
The $ZTIMEOUT fired correctly!!
