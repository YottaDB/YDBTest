# Test GTM-9102 : MUPIP FREEZE -ONLINE is consistent across regions except for AIO
##################################################################################
# Force BG as access method as ONLINE FREEZE does not work on MM regions
# Create 2-region database where ^a updates go to a.dat and ^b updates go to b.dat
# Start updates in background that set ^a=i and ^b=i+1 in a loop
# Run MUPIP FREEZE -ONLINE -ON "*"
# Capture online freeze output in a deterministic order
# First capture list of regions that got frozen in a sorted order (to keep it determninistic)
AREG : Region AREG is now FROZEN
DEFAULT : Region DEFAULT is now FROZEN
# Copy over the a.dat and b.dat files over to a [bak] directory (effectively taking a snapshot after online freeze)
# Unfreeze the regions now that the snapshot has been taken
# Stop background updates
# Run [mupip rundown] first on the snapshot as the backup .dat files still have references to live db shmid
# Verify that multi-region online freeze snapshot has ^a and ^b differing by at most 1
# Before GTM-9102 fixes, the difference would be a lot more than 1 (e.g. 55)
VERIFY-S-PASS : Verification passed. Difference between ^a and ^b is = [1] as expected
# Run dbcheck.csh
