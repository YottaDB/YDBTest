# Running v63014/gtm9332 - Test rollover of lock wakeups counter using white-box test case. Prior to
# V63014, this condition could leave a process thinking that it got a lock when it did not. So we grab
# a lock and release it 3 times each time verifying with a call to LKE that we actually got the lock.

# Drive gtm9332 test routine

# Drive 2 worker processes - we expect these to succeed on V63014 and later and
# to fail on earlier versions. Each worker process tries to acquire a timed lock and releases
# it in a 3-iteration loop. In each iteration it expects to get the lock so we verify that
# $TEST is set to 1 and that LKE SHOW shows that we are the owner of the lock. The LKE SHOW
# verification part would fail without the GTM-9332 fixes.
