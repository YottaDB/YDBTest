A regression was introduced in GT.M V6.3-009 that produced incorrect
output on calls to %HO when the input was between DE0B6B3A7640001
and FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (1000000000000000001 to 1152921504606846975 in decimal).
While this shows up as a rare failure for v63005/gtm5574, this test
is intended to specifically test for this regression by generating only
numbers in the range where %HO returns incorrect results. The test generates
10 random numbers in this range because some numbers, particularly those
where the final digit of the number is a 0, may be converted to the correct
octal number.
