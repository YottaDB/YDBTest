A regression was introduced in GT.M V6.3-006 that produced an
assert failure or a GTMCHECK fatal error when this script was
executed. This was fixed as part of V6.3-009. This test
functions as a test for both YottaDB issue ydb441 and GT.M issue
gtm-9114 verifying that auto-ZLINK works properly when zlinking
a new version of an M routine after changing ZROUTINES.
%YDB-E-ZLINKFILE, Error while zlinking "bar2",%YDB-E-ZLMODULE, Object file name does not match module name: bar
