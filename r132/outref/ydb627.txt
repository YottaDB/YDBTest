# Test that $FNUMBER(NUM,"",N)=NUM returns 0 when N is non-zero and NUM is an integer
# This might seem counter-intuitive but is how M has defined $FNUMBER behavior
# And this test ensures it continues to stay that way and alert us if any inadvertent change to this happens

Running : write $FNUMBER(3,"",1)=3 : Expecting to see 0 (and not 1) : Actual output = 0
Running : write "3.0"=3            : Expecting to see 0 (and not 1) : Actual output = 0
Running : write 3.0=3              : Expecting to see 1 (and not 0) : Actual output = 1
