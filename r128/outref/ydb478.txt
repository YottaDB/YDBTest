ydb478: Tests that after the ydb_exit() call (via yottadb.Exit()), Go is still able
        to field signal interrupts. Tests each signal from 1-64 though some of these
        will fail since they are not handle-able or they create cores so some signals
        are bypassed.
# Running : go get -d -v -x -t lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb
** First build ydb478 executable to create a handler for a given signal and see
** if things work properly after the YDB environment is initialized and then gets
** shutdown.
