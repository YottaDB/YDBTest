# Test that endiancvt does not proceed if minor-dbver is not same as current version
# We know that any version <= V63000A_R100 has a minor db-ver different from the current or any future version
# So create database using that older version and try to endiancvt it using the current version
# Randomly choose a prior V5 version that is <= V63000A_R100 to create the database first.
Randomly chosen prior V5 version is : ##FILTERED##GTM_TEST_DEBUGINFO.*
