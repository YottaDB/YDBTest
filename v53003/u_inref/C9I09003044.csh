# C9I09003044 : ZSHOW "G" implements process-private GVSTATS
#

# Disable randomtn as CTN statistic will depend on db tn and we want a static reference file
setenv gtm_test_disable_randomdbtn

# Disable mupip-set-version as that will disturb CTN statistic and in turn affect the static reference file
setenv gtm_test_mupip_set_version "disable"

# Disable dupsetnoop as a few statistics (particularly NBW or TBW) will be affected by it
setenv gtm_gvdupsetnoop "0"

setenv gtm_poollimit 0 # This test measure GVSTATS and having gtm_poollimt randomly would cause issues.

# blocksize should be at least 1024 as otherwise ZSHOW "G" output can wrap in multiple lines and cause test reference file issues.

# 8) Test that MUPIP INTRPT on an active GT.M process creates a GTM_ZSHOW_DUMP file with ZSHOW "G" stats.
# This test is not necessary since ZSHOW "*" is tested above (that it includes ZSHOW "G" stats) and there is
# a separate existing test (jobexam related test) that tests that MUPIP INTRPT results in ZSHOW "*"
#
# 9) Process private global access statistics will be gathered only for regions whose corresponding segments have an
#    access method of BG or MM in the global directory. For regions with other access methods, for example GT.CM GNP
#    which maps a region/segment to a remote database file, ZSHOW "G" will not report any process private statistics even
#    though aggregated statistics (across all processes) will continue to be gathered in the remote database file header.
#
#	--> This is tested by doing ZSHOW "G", VIEW "GVSTATSRESET" and $VIEW("GVSTATS",<reg>) in
#		test/gtcm_gnp/inref/gtcm.m (which runs as part of the gtcm_gnp/basic subtest)
