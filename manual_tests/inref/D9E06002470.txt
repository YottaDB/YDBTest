D9E06-002470 NFS file create fails with ACP error

The test is to create a file on the
NFS mounted disk and then read it.
Also, read an existing file.  Do
this both while set default to the
NFS directory specifying only the
file name and from a local directory
specifying the full dev:[dir]file.name.

Background information on required setup to perform tests

This requires a UNIX filesystem to be
NFS mounted on a VMS system which has
NFS proxies properly setup for the user
doing the test.

In HP TCPIP services, to add a proxy
(requires SYSPRV and SYSLCK, only needs
to be done once due to /perm):

  tcpip add proxy vmsuser/nfs=out/host=unixhost/uid=unixuid/gid=unixgid/perm

To mount a UNIX disk (doesn't need
privileges due to /share):

  tcpip mount dnfs: /path="/path/exported/from/unix"/host=unixhost/share

A DNFS device will be created.  Note that
DNFS0: is a template only and should not
be referenced.

Yeti, asgard, and wiglaf are in lespaul's
/etc/netgroup so can mount /ext1/gtc/staff.

Do "show dev dnfs" (on Bilbo with TCPWare,
"show dev nfs") to see which device was
allocated.  A logical to be defined can
also be specified on the mount.  On Bilbo,
nfs500: is Atlas' /home and a proxy
should be predefined for your SCA userid.
If not, contact ATS.
