smoketest is run before the other tests are run.
No need to run this test as a part of manual tests that is run at the end of testing process for a release.

INSTRUCTIONS: (For now this is UNIX only)

* Create a single region database
	> gde e # or run dtgbldir
	> mupip create

* Run smoketest.m smokepct.m and redirect the output to smoketest.out
	> cp $gtm_test/T990/manual_tests/inref/smoketest.m .
	> cp $gtm_test/T990/manual_tests/inref/smokepct.m .
	> mumps -run smoketest >&! smoketest.out
	> mumps -run smokepct >&! smokepct.out

* Compare the output with smoketest.out in u_outref
	> vim -do smoketest.out $gtm_test/T990/manual_tests/u_outref/smoketest.out
	> vim -do smokepct.out $gtm_test/T990/manual_tests/u_outref/smokepct.out
	> #(diff -bcw if vim isn't available)

* Other than the known differences like $H, $R(x), Terminal, $Job, Memory details (Zallocstr etc) the output should visually match.

Once the above passes, check the last few commented lines in smoketest.m. Those commands should be executed manually since either they are interactive commands or commands that error out.
	> tail $gtm_test/T990/manual_tests/inref/smoketest.m
	; The following should be executed on their own as part of the smoke test milestone
	; > setenv EDITOR vi
	; > gtm
	; YDB> zedit "foo"
	;
	; YDB> zsy
	; then cntl-d to get back to gtm prompt
	;
	; YDB> w !,$R(-10) ; when this is executed it should give an error

NOTE : At various stages of the porting, commands from smoketest.m and smokepct.m can be just copied and executed, if the full routine cannot be executed successfully.
