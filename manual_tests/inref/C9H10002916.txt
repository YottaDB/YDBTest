C9H10-002916 When $Principal SOCKET device is lost process should terminate

=========================== Expect automated instructions ============================
The instructions below are automated. Please follow these steps to run this test:

1) Make sure PRO version is built on the platforms you are testing for. This test only works with PRO because this is not a weekly
test. It is meant to be used only testing release versions. It has always bee PRO-only and we won't spend time to enhance it to pro
unless necessary.

2) Login as yourself and run the test such as: $gtm_test/T988/manual_tests/u_inref/manual_netd.csh V9XX (where V9XX is the version
   	 number. Takes a couple of minutes to run on each box) Tip: use cssh to run this test on multiple boxes

3) Verify all the tests exited without hanging. NOPRINCIO syslog message is verified by the test. If the test can not find NOPRINCIO
after 5 minutes, it will fail.

      WARNING: Some boxes may hang right before exiting the test. We suspect it is due to a bug or implementation differences in
      inetd. Just verify the actual test is passed and "NOPRINCIO." message is there.  Exit with ctrl-C and clean up "expect"
      processes if there is any.

=========================== Setup Instructions ============================
Note: It's best to run a multi-terminal setup like cssh/terminator/multiterm
to speed this up. This is how I tested. :)

The script test/manual_tests/u_inref/c002916.csh automates every part of this
test in a platform neutral way. Note that the DEFAULT is not HELP.
	Usage of test/manual_tests/u_inref/c002916.csh
	help | usage : display this help
	show | info  : validate the current configuration (DEFAULT)
	enable       : (must run as root) enable the C9H10002916 [x]inetd configuration. establish the [x]inetd configuration if necessary. you must 'test/manual_tests/u_inref/c002916.csh restart'
	disable      : (must run as root) disable the C9H10002916 [x]inetd configuration. you must 'test/manual_tests/u_inref/c002916.csh restart'
	restart      : (must run as root) restart the [x]inetd server after a configuration change
	server       : (must run as root) change the target server of the [x]inetd configuration.
	client       : (should be run as a regular user) run the C9H10002916 client and validate/dump some of the output

As it stands today, all GG servers have been [x]inetd installed and configured
to do this test. The configuration is disabled. If the server has not been
setup, just running the enable command will insert the [x]inetd configuration.


To setup for the test you need to su to root and do the following commands in
the TCSH (/usr/local/bin/csh) shell. Each command is shown with output from a
system running inetd.

WARNING: Solaris 10 doesn't work with the supplied script below. Please refer
the Solaris 10 section way below. At moment, atlst2000 is the only Solaris 10
server.

=========================== Testing Instructions ============================
As a non-root user, run the either the client program or telnet <host> <port>.
Make sure to 'ver V990' first. The script saves the complete interaction log
to client_c002916_${HOST:r:r:r}.log.
> ver V990 p
> $gtm_test/T990/manual_tests/u_inref/c002916.csh client

The client script asks for host and port. Just use the defaults. The client
will also ask "test lost read or write [read] ? ". Excercise both the read and
write options.  The script will wait for the NOPRINCIO message in syslog and
print out socket information logged by the server.

Please compare the excerpted output from the script with the validation steps
below.


====================== Original Validation Instructions ======================
After each try, check the syslog for a NOPRINCIO message for the server job
(the 27597 below which should match $JOB in c2916out.txt.)

Dec 23 19:47:22 jackal GTM[27597]: %GTM-F-NOPRINCIO, Unable to write to principal device -- generated from 0x00DB4751.

Even for reads, the "write" in the message is correct since it is issued when
GT.M is unable to write an error message to $PRINCIPAL.

The file c2916out.txt in the server's working directory contains diagnostic
output from the server.  Below are extracts which show what is expected.

Solaris 10 does not work like everything else. :(

Please read and understand the following commands. I have left the
configuration for gtmserver installed, but disabled.

- Install the service (converts the old inetd config to the SMH model)
# inetconv -i $gtm_test/T990/manual_tests/u_inref/C9H10002916.inetd
gtmserver -> /var/svc/manifest/network/gtmserver-tcp.xml
Importing gtmserver-tcp.xml ...Done

- List the services
# inetadm
ENABLED   STATE          FMRI
enabled   maintenance    svc:/network/gtmserver/tcp:default

- Disable the service (includes HUPing inetd)
# inetadm -d svc:/network/gtmserver/tcp:default

- Enable the service (includes HUPing inetd)
# inetadm -e svc:/network/gtmserver/tcp:default

- List the service properties
# inetadm -l svc:/network/gtmserver/tcp:default

- Edit the service's properties (the example changes the user and target
  script)
# inetadm -m svc:/network/gtmserver/tcp:default user=gtmtest exec="/gtc/staff/gtm_test/current/T990/manual_tests/u_inref/C9H10002916.sh"

- Remove the service
# svccfg delete svc:/network/gtmserver/tcp:default
