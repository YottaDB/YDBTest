Terminal I/O:
-----------------------------------------------

Copy terminal.m and longstr.m into current directory
On VMS:
  copy gtm$troot:[T990.manual_tests.inref]terminal.m []
  copy gtm$troot:[T990.common]longstr.m []

On UNIX:
  cp $gtm_test/T990/manual_tests/inref/terminal.m .
  cp $gtm_test/T990/com/longstr.m .

1. Run:

(set terminal emulator to autowrap, 132 columns)
stty cols 132 ; stty -a

gtm
YDB>do ^terminal

(On VMS, do a set term/inquire before to reset terminal characteristics)
-----------------------------------------------
2. cut-and-paste the output into a file (terminal.out)
   capturing a log using script, set host, or the
   emulator's logging facility will not work.

Notes :
   * Sometimes cut and paste will leave out an extra space at the end of the line.
     For e.g at line 7 where "B" must be followed by a space. So watch out while copying and comparing the output to terminal.txt
   * Highlighting(copy) and pasting in vim of VMS might not sometimes work. In such cases, paste it to a text editor
     like "Text Editor" or "Kwrite" etc and then rcp it back to VMS
-----------------------------------------------
3. diff $gtm_test/TXXX/manual_tests/outref/terminal.txt terminal.out
  diff terminal.out gtm$troot:[T990.manual_tests.outref]terminal.txt

   There may be some differences in the zshow "D" output
   such as "IN" vs "NOINSE".

   There will also be differences in dev terminal name like dev /pts 2 against
   dev /pts 12. This can be ignored

   In HP-UX there's an extra diff of GTM$DMOD against +1^GTM$DMOD which we ignore.

-----------------------------------------------
4. diff $gtm_test/TXXX/manual_tests/zshow.txt zshow.out
   diff zshow.out gtm$troot:[T990.manual_tests.outref]zshow.txt
(note that in VMS doing a diff other way round will not work)

-----------------------------------------------
5. run the following (note output to terminal will occur while typing:)

YDB>use $PRINCIPAL:(X=0:Y=0:CLEARSCREEN) write "HERE: ",$X,",",$Y,! use $PRINCIPAL:(X=8:y=2) write "HERE: ",$X,",",$Y,!

Your screen should look like (at the top of the screen):
HERE: 6,0

        HERE: 14,2

YDB>

now do:

YDB>use $PRINCIPAL:(X=1:Y=1) write "HERE: ",$X,",",$Y,!

Screen should be:
HERE: 6,0
 HERE: 7,1
        HERE: 14,2
YDB>

(On VMS, do a set term/inquire before to reset terminal characteristics)
-----------------------------------------------
6. Run:
gtm
YDB>do test2^terminal

The output is self-explanatory.

(On VMS, do a set term/inquire before to reset terminal characteristics)
-----------------------------------------------
7. Run:
(assuming longstr.m is already copied - the very first step of this manual test)
gtm
YDB>write $$^longstr(35000)
This should produce a lot of output (many alphabets), but should not error out.
-----------------------------------------------



-----------------------------------------------
You can now run this test in an automated fashion from a desktop PC using
expect. You should be able to cut and paste the entire block below.

Requirements: unix2dos or fromdos (tofrodos package)

tcsh
set prompt="terminal `hostname`:$PWD >"
set gtm_tst=$gtm_test/T990
set tst=manual_tests
mkdir -p /testarea1/$user/${gtm_verno}/drive_terminal
cd /testarea1/$user/${gtm_verno}/drive_terminal
which dos2unix
which fromdos && alias dos2unix fromdos
foreach host ( `$cms_tools/expand_serverlist.csh all` )
echo $host
expect -f $gtm_tst/$tst/u_inref/remote_terminal.exp $host $gtm_tst manual_tests ${gtm_verno} p > & ! terminal_${host}.log
if !(-e terminal_${host}.log) continue
awk '{while(getline){if($0 ~/^2/){pf=1};if($0 ~/GTM/){pf=0} if(pf){print}}}' terminal_${host}.log > terminal_${host}.out
dos2unix terminal_${host}.out && diff -u $gtm_tst/$tst/outref/terminal.txt terminal_${host}.out && rm terminal_${host}.out
end
exit
