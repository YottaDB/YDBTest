at the GTM prompt:

you should see the following

>[input <CTRL-C> now]

you should see:

%YDB-I-CTRLC, CTRL_C encountered

at the GTM prompt:
	zshow "v":y

>[input <CTRL-C> now]

you should see:

%YDB-I-CTRLC, CTRL_C encountered

at the GTM prompt:
	zwrite a

>[input <CTRL-C> now]

you should see:

%YDB-I-CTRLC, CTRL_C encountered

at the GTM prompt:
	xecute "zwrite a"

>[input <CTRL-C> now]

in UNIX, you should NOT see ANY:

%YDB-I-CTRLC, CTRL_C encountered

you should (eventually) see:

a="                                                                                               100000"

but in VMS you should see:

%YDB-I-CTRLC, CTRL_C encountered

at the GTM prompt:

	do lke^ctrlc

>[input <CTRL-C> now]

%YDB-I-CTRLC, CTRL_C encountered

at the GTM prompt:

you should see:
