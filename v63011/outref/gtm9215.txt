# This test checks that setting zstatus to strings that would be exponential numbers and then writing it
# results in the string being written as expected not a %YDB-E-NUMOFLOW error. In upstream versions prior to
# V6.3-011 and YottaDB versions based on those versions, this would result in a %YDB-E-NUMOFLOW but the string
# could still be read by doing a zshow i.
