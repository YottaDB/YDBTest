# Test that 'ZCompile "bar2.edit"' issues NOTMNAME error instead of compiling
# GT.M V6.3-006 started issuing the NOTMNAME error (see http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V6.3-006_Release_Notes.html#GTM-8178)
# But there was an inconsistency in ZCOMPILE that is addressed as part of YottaDB r1.26 (after integrating GT.M V6.3-006) and this is a test of that.
