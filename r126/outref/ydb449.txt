# Test that reverse $order/$query functions work correctly when $increment/VIEW "NOISOLATION" is in use
# Disable ASYNCIO in test as it can cause rare test hangs and is not the primary purpose of this test
# No GDB output will be printed if the test passes
# If it fails the bad lines will end up in the log file
# The full gdb output is in the gdb*.out files
