# Test that "lke clnup" will clears unowned locks
# The LKE CLNUP command clears the lock space of locks abandoned by processes that exited abnormally
# In addition to the standard -region and -all flags, the command has two optional command line flags:
#	While the command by default runs once and terminates, the -periodic=n qualifier instructs LKE CLNUP to run in a loop, performing a cleanup every n seconds, a lighter weight operation than invoking the LKE command every n seconds from a shell script.
#	The -integ option instructs the command to also validate the data structures in the lock space for structural integrity.
