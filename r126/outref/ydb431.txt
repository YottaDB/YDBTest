Buffer length test
$get(a("sub0",1,"sub2",3,"This subscript is extra long so that we can go over the 512 byte size of the LVUNDEF buffer. Although as it turns out 512 characters, one byte being one ascii character, is really rather alot. The start of this string was at byte 25 of the line, and as of right now I am only at 230. I need to somehow reach at 537, and this is getting a little silly so here is the abc's: Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz. Numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25."))
