# Verify that waitpid() does not rely on timers when they are unavailable or process is exiting.
# In the test we need to ensure that the waitpid() function is invoked while SIGALRMs are blocked,
# which is the case while we are processing a timer handler. To avoid introducing a new white-box
# test, we rely on an external call to schedule a short timer and then trigger the CLOSE of a
# previously OPENed pipe in its handler.

# Compile and link the test program.
