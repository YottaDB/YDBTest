# This test case provides regression support that validates the maximum path
# allowed for $gtm_dist. Previous code checks incorrectly calculated the length
# of $gtm_dist, a slash and the executables name throughout the code prior to
# using a target. This could lead to situations where libyottadb.so,
# gtmsecshrdir or a plugin (encryption) library are inaccessible due to path
# limitations.
#
# Going forward, GT.M reserves 50 bytes* for internal paths beyond $gtm_dist to
# support the current maximum path of 47 characters for the encyrption plugin
# library "utf8/plugin/libgtmcrypt_openssl_BLOWFISHCFB.so". Note
# gtmcrypt_entry.c does a realpath() of the encyrption libraries using a buffer
# of size GTM_PATH_MAX prior to dlopen()ing them.
#
# An interesting tidbit about gtmsecshr startup. $gtm_dist/gtmsecshr CDs to
# $gtm_dist/gtmsecshrdir and then executes ./gtmsecshr from that directory.
# Because it does not use the absolute path, it avoids hitting maximum path
# length errors. So as long as $gtm_dist/gtmsecshrdir fits in GTM_PATH_MAX, we
# can always execute $gtm_dist/gtmsecshrdir/gtmsecshr.
#
# * The build scripts need to watch the path lengths after the builds complete
#
