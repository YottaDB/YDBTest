# Test to ensure that all currently defined GT.M messages are printed correctly in the terminal or syslog,

# ZMESSAGE facility to generate every message used by GT.M. The arguments supplied to a ZMESSAGE command
# are recorded and later matched against the arguments extracted out of the actual messages, taking into
# consideration numeric overflows, type casting, and width and filling requirements.
