# This test exists to verify that MUMPS/MUPIP/DSE/LKE can validate that they
# reside in $gtm_dist.
#

#
# MUMPS dlopen()s $gtm_dist/libyottadb.so which in effect validates $gtm_dist.
# It uses $gtm_dist for help, the JOB command, as a search path for pipe
# devices, and to call gtmsecshr.
#
# MUMPS call-ins work differently, see gtm7926callins for more information.
#
# MUPIP relies on $gtm_dist directly for help and for starting the
# Update/Helper Process (tested in gtm7926rcvr) and for calling gtmsecshr.
#
# LKE relies on $gtm_dist when calling help.
#
# DSE relies on $gtm_dist for help and for calling gtmsecshr.
#
# MUMPS/MUPIP/DSE/LKE all implicitly rely on $gtm_dist/plugin/libgtmcrypt.so when
# using encryption. If $gtm_dist is not ok to use then encryption initilization
# will fail. LKE only opens the database for LKE SHOW
#
# The GT.CM OMI server relies on $gtm_dist directly when processing error
# messages (tested in v54002/C9K08003311).
#

#
# The tests below use the helper script test/v62000/inref_u/gethelp.csh to
# drive the HELP function for MUPIP, DSE, and LKE. Depending on the execution,
# we expect the executable to pass in most scenarios.
