# The following subtest tests that a GT.M v7.1-001 regression is not included in the YottaDB codebase.
# For more information see the discussion at: https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDBTest/-/issues/658#note_2332948688.

# Run test routine: Expect NUMOFLOW error
# Previously, in V71001, there was a regression such that this routine would incorrectly result in either:
#		1. dbg builds: %GTM-F-ASSERT, Assert failed in sr_port/gvcst_incr.c line 40 for expression (MV_IS_NUMERIC(increment))
#		2. pro builds: no error
%GTM-E-NUMOFLOW, Numeric overflow
		At M source location numoflowreg+3^numoflowreg
