# ^%RANDSTR limits the range argument upper limit to the actual number of characters available in the current character set - 256 for M mode and 65,536 for UTF-8 mode. Previously, a missing or defective upper limit caused the routine to perform unproductive processing that could consume unreasonable amounts of time. The workaround was to avoid inappropriate range arguments. (GTM-DE500856)

# Run M routines that call ^%RANDSTR with various range argument upper limits,
# then confirm that each routine runs in less than 1.5 million instructions.
# Previously, these routines would have hung for long periods without issuing any output.

# Test 1. Defective range argument upper limit, e.g.: '1:1:2**32'
PASS: Took less than 150000000 instructions

# Test 2. Missing range argument upper limit, i.e. '1:1'
PASS: Took less than 150000000 instructions
