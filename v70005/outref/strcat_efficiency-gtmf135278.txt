# Check that concatenating strings that already happen to be at the end of the stringpool
# produces very fast concatenation operations. We have seen the CPU instructions range
# from 15 million to 60 million with V70005 and go as high as 530 million with V70004.
# So we set the limit at 65,000,000 CPU instructions and treat anything less than that as a PASS.

# Test1: fast concatenating of strings that already exist at the end of stringpool
##TEST_AWKCPU instructions=[0-9]+
PASS: Took less than 65000000 instructions

# Test2: fast concatenating of existing stringpool strings plus an appended string
##TEST_AWKCPU instructions=[0-9]+
PASS: Took less than 65000000 instructions
