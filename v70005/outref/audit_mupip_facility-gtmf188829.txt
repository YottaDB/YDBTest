# Release note http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-005_Release_Notes.html#GTM-F188829 says:
#
# > When the restriction file contains a line specifying
# > AM_ENABLE, commands typed at the MUPIP prompt (MUPIP>) are
# > audit logged and executed the same as MUPIP shell commands.
# > Note that MUPIP returns to the shell after each command.
# > Previously, when this facility was enabled, all commands
# > typed at the MUPIP prompt (MUPIP>) produced the RESTRICTEDOP
# > error. (GTM-F188829)
