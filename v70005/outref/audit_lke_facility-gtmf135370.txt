# GTM-F135370 - Test the following release note
# *****************************************************************
#
# Release note (http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-005_Release_Notes.html#GTM-F135370) says:
#
# > When the restriction file contains a line specifying
# > AL_ENABLE, LKE establishes a connection, a via socket, to
# > a logger/listener process, and sends all commands,
# > designating src=5, and using the socket to the listener
# > for audit logging. If sending succeeds, LKE executes the
# > command. If the connection or the send fail, LKE issues a
# > RESTRICTEDOP error and does not execute the command.
# > AL_ENABLE supports TCP, TLS or UNIX socket types. By
# > default, LKE commands execute without logging. Previously,
# > LKE did not provide an audit logging option. (GTM-F135370)

# ---- startup ----
# prepare read-write $gtm_dist directory
# compile audit_listener utility
# allocate a port number for TCP and TLS modes
# set Unix socket filename
# set crypt config file path and name
# set-up crypt config file for section clicert
# create database
# get group ID for restrict.txt

# ---- test tcp logging ----
# setup restrict.txt: audit logging with tcp
# attempt to execute a LKE command, but no audit listener is running
%GTM-F-RESTRICTEDOP, Attempt to perform a restricted operation: LKE
# launch tcp audit_listener
# wait for pidfile
# execute a LKE command, will be logged as well
%GTM-I-NOLOCKMATCH, No matching locks were found in DEFAULT
# wait for entries added to log
# show log captured (should be the LKE command):
<timestamp_masked>; dist=<masked>; src=5; uid=<masked>; euid=<masked>; pid=<masked>; tty=<masked>; command=CLEAR -NOINTERACTIVE -LOCK="^ThisShouldBeLogged"
# reset log by sending SIGHUP to the audit listener
# setup restrict.txt: no audit logging
# execute a LKE command, will be not logged
%GTM-I-NOLOCKMATCH, No matching locks were found in DEFAULT
# wait for entries added to log (won't happen)
# show log captured (should be empty):
# stop audit_listener and wait for finish

# ---- test tls logging ----
# setup restrict.txt: audit logging with tls
# attempt to execute a LKE command, but no audit listener is running
%GTM-F-RESTRICTEDOP, Attempt to perform a restricted operation: LKE
# launch tls audit_listener
# wait for pidfile
# execute a LKE command, will be logged as well
%GTM-I-NOLOCKMATCH, No matching locks were found in DEFAULT

# wait for entries added to log (won't happen)
# show log captured (should be empty):
# stop audit_listener and wait for finish

# ---- test unix_socket logging ----
# setup restrict.txt: audit logging with unix_socket
# attempt to execute a LKE command, but no audit listener is running
%GTM-F-RESTRICTEDOP, Attempt to perform a restricted operation: LKE
# launch unix_socket audit_listener
# wait for pidfile
# execute a LKE command, will be logged as well
%GTM-I-NOLOCKMATCH, No matching locks were found in DEFAULT
# wait for entries added to log
# show log captured (should be the LKE command):
<timestamp_masked>; dist=<masked>; src=5; uid=<masked>; euid=<masked>; pid=<masked>; tty=<masked>; command=CLEAR -NOINTERACTIVE -LOCK="^ThisShouldBeLogged"

%GTM-I-NOLOCKMATCH, No matching locks were found in DEFAULT
# wait for entries added to log (won't happen)
# show log captured (should be empty):
# stop audit_listener and wait for finish

# ---- cleanup ----
# shutdown database
# release port number
