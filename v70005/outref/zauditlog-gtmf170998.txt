# GTM-F170998 - Test the following release note
# *****************************************************************
#
# Release note (http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-005_Release_Notes.html#GTM-F170998) says:
#
# > The $ZAUDITLOG() function establishes a connection via a
# > socket and sends its argument to a logger/listener process.
# > It requires setting the AZA_ENABLE audit logging facility in
# > the $gtm_dist/restrict.txt file. The format for the
# > $ZAUDITLOG() function is:
# >
# > ZAUDITLOG(expr)
# >
# > expr specifies the string to send for audit logging
# >
# > $ZAUDITLOG() identifies its message with src=4, and like
# > other GT.M logging facilities, records the location of GT.M
# > distribution, uid, euid, pid, tty, and the
# > command / argument(s).
# >
# > A return of: TRUE (1) indicates successful logging,
# > FALSE (0) indicates logging is not enabled; a trappable
# > RESTRICTEDOP error indicates logging is enabled but not
# > working.
# >
# > If LGDE is specified as an option for the AZA_ENABLE facility,
# > GDE logs all commands. GT.M ignores this option if specified
# > with other A\*\_ENABLE audit logging facilities. When it fails
# > to log a command, GDE issues a GDELOGFAIL error. The following
# > table characterizes $ZAUDITLOG() and GDE audit logging behavior:
# >
# > **$ZAUDITLOG() / GDE logging Characteristics**
# >
# > | AZA_ENABLE   | LGDE   | Logging success   | GDE audit logging   | $ZAUDITLOG() result  |
# > |--------------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
# > | Yes          | Yes    | Yes               | Yes                 | 1                     |

# > | Yes          | Yes    | No                | GDELOGFAIL error    | RESTRICTEDOP error    |
# > | Yes          | No     | No                | No                  | RESTRICTEDOP error    |
