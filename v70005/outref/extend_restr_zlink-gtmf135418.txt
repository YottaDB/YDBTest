# Release note (http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-005_Release_Notes.html#GTM-F135418) says:
#
# > The GT.M restrictions facility recognizes ZLINK, ZRUPDATE and
# > SET $ZROUTINES. When an explicit ZLINK (not auto-zlink),
# > ZRUPDATE, or SET $ZROUTINES restriction conditions are
# > configured, the restricted command issues a RESTRICTEDOP error
# > message. Previously, the restrictions facility did not support
# > ZLINK, ZRUPDATE, or SET $ZROUTINES. (GTM-F135418)
