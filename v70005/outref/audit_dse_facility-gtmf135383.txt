# GTM-F135383 - Test the following release note
# *****************************************************************
#
# Release Note (http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-005_Release_Notes.html#GTM-F135383) says:
#
# > When the restriction file specifies AD_ENABLE, DSE establishes
# > a connection via a socket, to a logger/listener process, and
# > sends all commands, designating src=6, and using the socket
# > to the listener for audit logging. If sending succeeds, DSE
# > executes the command. If the connection or the send fail, DSE
# > issues a RESTRICTEDOP error and does not execute the command.
# > AD_ENABLE supports TCP, TLS or UNIX socket types. By default,
# > DSE commands execute without logging. Previously, DSE did not
# > provide an audit logging option. (GTM-F135383)

# ---- startup ----
# prepare read-write $gtm_dist directory
# compile audit_listener utility
# allocate a port number for TCP and TLS modes
# set Unix socket filename
# set crypt config file path and name
# set-up crypt config file for section clicert
# create database
# get group ID for restrict.txt

# ---- test tcp logging ----
# setup restrict.txt: audit logging with tcp
# attempt to execute a DSE command (filtered output), but no audit listener is running
Region	DEFAULT
%GTM-F-RESTRICTEDOP, Attempt to perform a restricted operation: DSE
# launch tcp audit_listener
# wait for pidfile
# execute a DSE command (filtered output), will be logged as well
Region	DEFAULT
# wait for entries added to log
# show log captured (should be the DSE command):
<timestamp_masked>; dist=<masked>; src=6; uid=<masked>; euid=<masked>; pid=<masked>; tty=<masked>; command=exit
# reset log by sending SIGHUP to the audit listener
# setup restrict.txt: no audit logging
# execute a DSE command (filtered output), will be not logged
Region	DEFAULT
# wait for entries added to log (won't happen)
# show log captured (should be empty):
# stop audit_listener and wait for finish

# ---- test tls logging ----
# setup restrict.txt: audit logging with tls
# attempt to execute a DSE command (filtered output), but no audit listener is running
Region	DEFAULT

# ---- test unix_socket logging ----
# setup restrict.txt: audit logging with unix_socket
# attempt to execute a DSE command (filtered output), but no audit listener is running
Region	DEFAULT
%GTM-F-RESTRICTEDOP, Attempt to perform a restricted operation: DSE
# launch unix_socket audit_listener
# wait for pidfile
# execute a DSE command (filtered output), will be logged as well
Region	DEFAULT
