# Release note (from http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-005_Release_Notes.html#GTM-DE340860)
# 
# MUPIP BACKUP does not leave temporary files when there in an error during the copy phase for a
# multi-region backup. Previously, MUPIP BACKUP incorrectly left temporary files when there was an error
# during the copy phase for any region except the first. (GTM-DE340860)
# 
# Create 2-region database (AREG and DEFAULT)
Files Created in ##TEST_PATH##:
Using: ##SOURCE_PATH##/mumps -run GDE
mumps.gld
Using: ##SOURCE_PATH##/mupip
a.dat
mumps.dat
# We want to induce an error in the copy phase of the second region. Towards that we let AREG database
# file stay in the current directory and keep DEFAULT database file in /tmp (see Test 1c in
# v70001/u_inref/gtm9424.csh for more details).

%GDE-I-GDUPDATE, Updating Global Directory file 
	##TEST_PATH##/mumps.gld
# Recreate DEFAULT database to point to /tmp
##TEST_AWK%GTM-I-DBFILECREATED, Database file /tmp/mumps_.*.dat created
# Now attempt a mupip backup on both AREG and DEFAULT where the target is [bkpdir] a subdirectory in the current directory.
# AREG backup should work fine but we would see an EXDEV error while trying to backup DEFAULT database.
# In GT.M V7.0-004 and older versions, this would cause temporary files to be left over and an [Error removing temp dir]
# error message displayed. In GT.M V7.0-005 and above, this error would not show up.

%GTM-I-TEXT, Error occurred during the copy phase of MUPIP BACKUP
%GTM-I-TEXT, EXDEV, Invalid cross-device link for backing up region DEFAULT
##TEST_AWK%GTM-I-BKUPRETRY, Retrying MUPIP BACKUP for region: DEFAULT \(database file: /tmp/mumps_.*.dat\). Attempt: #2 of 2
##TEST_AWK%GTM-I-BACKUPDBFILE, DB file /tmp/mumps_.*.dat backed up in file ##TEST_PATH##/bkpdir/mumps_.*.dat
%GTM-I-BACKUPSUCCESS, Backup completed successfully
# Check the contents of [bkpdir] to ensure no leftover temporary files.
# Run [ls -la bkpdir]. We only expect to see a.dat and mumps.dat. Nothing else.
# When run with GT.M V7.0-004, we would see subdirectories like [DEFAULT_64441__1.tmp/] show up.
