# Release note (from http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.1-000_Release_Notes.html#GTM-F135385)
# 
# MUPIP RCTLDUMP reports the number of times a routine has been superseded (rtnsupersede) in the autorelink cache. Previously,
# MUPIP RCTLDUMP did not record this value, and only recorded the number of times a routine has been referenced. (GTM-F135385)

# Create routine directories `obj` and `src`
# Set gtmroutines to use routine directories with autorelink enabled

# Generate the first test routine version in src/gtmf135385.m
# Precompile src/gtmf135385.m into src/gtmf135385.o to ensure compilation completes before new routine
#   versions are compiled in the loop below. This is done to prevent a rare failure case where the above
#   version of the routine completes compilation after a subsequent version of the routine is compiled in
#   the below foreach loop. In that case, the above M code will execute more than once, causing multiple
#   mumps processes to hang indefinitely. In turn, this will prevent the below `foreach` loop from exiting
#   causing the test to hang indefinitely and thus to fail with a test execution timeout.
# Run the first version of the test routine in the background and capture the PID in gtmf135385-v0.pid
# Wait up to 300 seconds for backgrounded mumps process to start
# Run MUPIP RCTLDUMP to get the initial `superseded` value

# Generate and run new versions of the test routine, and run MUPIP RCTLDUMP after each routine exits
# Wait for each new mumps process to exit before running MUPIP RCTLDUMP to ensure the routine version was updated

# Check if `superseded` values are present and incremented in the output from the preceding MUPIP RCTLDUMP calls
