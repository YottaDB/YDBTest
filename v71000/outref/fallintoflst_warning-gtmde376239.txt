# Release note (from http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.1-000_Release_Notes.html#GTM-DE376239)
# 
# GT.M reports a FALLINTOFLST error after an argumentless DO embedded subroutine followed by a label with a formallist when no QUIT terminates the code after the DO block, except when there are no lines between the end of the embedded subroutine and the label with the formallist, in which case GT.M infers a QUIT would be appropriate to separate them. When GT.M inserts an implicit QUIT, it issues a FALLINOFLST warning unless compilation has a -NOWARNING qualifier. Previously, since the FALLINTOFLST error was introduced in V6.0-002, GT.M inappropriately gave that error for cases of that combination under circumstances where the QUIT was on the same line as the argumentless DO rather than explicitly between the embedded subroutine and the label with the formallist. (GTM-DE376239)

# YottaDB r2.04 will behave differently than r2.02 for the below test case.
# r2.02 will provide a clear FALLINTOFLST error while r2.04 will issue
# a confusing QUITARGREQD error (this happened because an implicit QUIT was
# inserted by GT.M/YottaDB and not because of a QUIT coded by the user).
# But we are going to keep the r2.04 behavior to be compatible with upstream
# GT.M and other M implementations.
# See note at https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDBTest/-/merge_requests/2197#note_2303484583
# for more details.
