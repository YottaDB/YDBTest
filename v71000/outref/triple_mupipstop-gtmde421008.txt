# Original GT.M release note (from http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.1-000_Release_Notes.html#GTM-DE421008):
# 
# MUPIP STOP three times within a minute logs the event to syslog and otherwise acts like a kill -9 by stopping a process at points that may not be safe, except that it may produce a core file; previously any three MUPIP STOPs over the life of a process acted like a kill -9 and produced no record of the event. (GTM-DE421008)

# Revised YottaDB release note:

# MUPIP STOP three times within a minute acts like a kill -9 by stopping a process at points that may not be safe, except that it may produce a core file; previously any three MUPIP STOPs over the life of a process acted like a kill -9. (GTM-DE421008)
