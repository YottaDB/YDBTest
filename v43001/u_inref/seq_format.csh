# The awk scripts used to sort lost transactions on the seqno are no longer necessary, simple sort will do:
# mupip_rollback.csh -resync=<JNL_SEQNO> -lost=lostxn.log "*"
# sort -n -k6,6 -t\\ lostxn.log
#The above will work for UNIX. For VMS, the equivalent of sort (the 6th field) needs to be done.

# extract.awk needs the PINI records to create of list of PIDs to mask the actual PIDs found in the later logical records.
# However, in this test case we are dealing with lost and broken records which need not contain all the PINI records
# generated until now. This will cause some logical records to be left without their associated PINI records and hence the
# reference files will not match. To avoid this, pass 1 for maskpid to unconditionally mask the PID found in the logical
# records
# extract.awk is used to check .lost and .broken files in the source side. The stream seqno will be "0" for non-suppl instance and non-zero for suppl instance

# Mask off volatile journal record fields like nodeflags (different between trigger supporting and trigger non-supporting
# platforms), timestamp and pid. Since the PFIN and PINI records do not contain sequence numbers and the purpose of this
# test is to sort the journal records by sequence number, it is okay not to include the PINI and PFIN in the final output
# Additionally, EOF records do contain sequence numbers but they show up sometimes in a different order (corresponding
# to the 3 regions) which is likely because of the way "sort" operates when the sorting key (-k6,6 above i.e. the jnl_seqno)
# is the same across the 3 EOF records but the dbtn (-k2,2) is different in DEFAULT compared to AREG and BREG. To avoid
# test failures due to this, filter out the last 3 lines in the first output and sort them separately a second time on dbtn.
