# MUPIP SET {-FILE|-REGION} accepts -TRIGGER_FLUSH=n and -WRITES_PER_FLUSH=n qualifiers; previously only DSE supported these qualifiers
# Also, the trigger_flush value appears in MUPIP DUMPFHEAD as flush_trigger_top (original GTM was trigger_flush_top) and acts as a stable limit; previously GT.M tended to lose any user supplied value as it made adjustments intended to improve performance
