# $ZCSTATUS holds an indication of the result of the last ZCOMPILE, ZLINK, $ZTRIGGER() or auto-zlink compilation
# One (1) indicates a clean compilation, a positive number greater than one is an error code you can turn into text with $ZMESSAGE(), and a negative number is a negated error code that indicates GT.M was not able to produce an object file
# The error details appear in the compilation output.
# Previously, $ZSTATUS almost always indicated a one (1) except when object file creation failed
# $ZTRIGGER() and MUPIP TRIGGER don't install trigger definitions with XECUTE strings that do not compile without error; previously they did
# In addition, the value for $ZCSTATUS provided by ZSHOW "I" matches that provided by WRITE $ZCSTATUS; previously ZSHOW provided a zero (0) when it should have provided a one (1)
