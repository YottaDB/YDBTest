# This is an automated test of https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDBTest/-/merge_requests/1909#note_1830824327

# Limit vmemoryuse to 200,000 for this test
# Run [mumps -run stpgcolsrcAssert]
# When run with GT.M V7.0-002 Debug build, we have seen this test fail an assert in stp_gcol_src.h
# When run with YottaDB, we have not seen this test fail. But since this test seems to be exercising
# an assert in a pure GT.M build, it is considered good enough to be included as an automated test case.
