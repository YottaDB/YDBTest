# 
# By default, GT.M proactively splits blocks when it detects significant restarts in an attempt to reduce overall
# restarts. MUPIP SET -FILE mumps.dat -PROBLKSPLIT=N where N is 0 disables proactive splitting, as do very large values
# of N. Values of N greater than 0 adjust the lower limit for the number of records below which GT.M does not consider
# splitting a block. While this is behavior is aimed at reducing restarts, because it reduces data density, it may also
# increase the number of blocks and even the tree depth. (GTM-F135414)

# GT.M V7.0-002 and later splits blocks and when it detects significant restarts
# So we need to induce restarts for block to be split
# This test sets PROBLKSPLIT to 3 different value which are 0,1 and 2
# 0 is for disable block splitting function : Expected data block to not be split at all which is 1
# 1 means adjust the lower limit for the number of records to 1 : Expected to be the most number of data blocks
# 2 means adjust the lower limit for the number of records to 2
# Expect that higher PROBLKSPLIT value will have lower number of data blocks

# Test Proactive block splitting function
