; Test to validate $[Z]LENGTH() with 2 arguments with a single char delimiter specified and its creation/use of the same
; look-aside cache that $[Z]PIECE() use.
;
; Methodology:
;   Create a string that looks like "1/2/3/4/5..." where each piece is delimited by the character '/' and each piece has the value
;   of the piece index. After adding each piece, and again after adding each delimiter, check the values returned by both $LENGTH and
;   $ZLENGTH then also using $[Z]PIECE() to pull off each token comparing it with the expected value in the list to make sure there
;   are no cache problems.

	. if (cpc'=tpcnt) write "FAIL -- [1] $LENGTH() expected to be ",tpcnt," but was ",cpc," instead",! set errcnt=errcnt+1

	; This next test is primarily a UTF8 test (and will run differently in UTF8 and M modes) but we'll run in both anyway to
	; be consistent. Start with a string that exceeds the number of pieces that can be kept in cache - the strbase string
	; created in the previous step is handy but we need to do 2 things:
	;   1. Turn off BADCHAR so we can have illegal UTF8 chars.
	;   2. Translate the current '/' delimiter to $zchar(132).
	; This allows us to append $char(196) to the end of the string. Note this is a 2 byte UTF8 character $zchar(195,132). Note the
	; 2nd byte is the same as the delimiter but should not be recognized as such by $LENGTH() since it is part of a valid
	; character.
	;
