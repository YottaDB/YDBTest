# GTM-F135381 - Test the following release note
# ********************************************************************************************
# 
# Release note (from http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-004_Release_Notes.html#GTM-F135381)
# 
# When the Audit MUPIP facility (AM_ENABLE) is enabled, MUPIP establishes a connection (via a UNIX/TCP/TLS socket)
# to a logger/listener process, and sends any MUPIP shell command through the socket to the listener for logging.
# If sending is successful, MUPIP executes the command. If the connection is not successful or sending of the command fails,
# then MUPIP produces an error and does not execute the command. When this facility is enabled, all commands typed at
# the MUPIP prompt (MUPIP>) produce the RESTRICTEDOP error. When this facility is disabled, which it is by default,
# MUPIP commands execute as usual.In addition, the APD_ENABLE facility displays the appropriate network error messages
# and exits the process gracefully. Previously, certain network errors could result in a segmentation fault without
# reporting the reason. (GTM-F135381)
# 
# This test only contains test below :
# - Test New error message : AUDINITFAIL, AUDCONNFAIL and AUDLOGFAIL
# 
# Notes:
# 1) Audit MUPIP facility already tested in v70005/audit_mupip_facility-gtmf188829
# (https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDBTest/-/merge_requests/2052) so this will not be tested here
# 2) APD_ENABLE Facility mentioned in later part of release note will not tested in this test
# because there is not enough description of the use case to come up with a test case.
# 

# Prepare read-write $gtm_dist directory
# compile audit_listener utility
# allocate a port number for TCP and TLS modes
# set Unix socket filename
# set crypt config file path and name
# set-up crypt config file for section clicert
# get group ID for restrict.txt

# Test 1) :  Test new error message : AUDINITFAIL, AUDCONNFAIL and AUDLOGFAIL
# 1.1) AUDINITFAIL : This message will show up in syslog when restriction file format is invalid
# AUDLOGFAIL will also show up in syslog as YottaDB/GT.M unable to send the to-be-logged activitiy to logger
# We will test for all mode including TCP, TLS, UNIX Socket by just setting up restrict.txt with invalid format
# Testing mode : tcp
# setup restrict.txt: for audit logging

# This will show RESTRICTEDOP error in stdout/stderr

# 1.2) AUDCONNFAIL : Facility for logging activity is enabled
# but is unable to form a connection with its configured logging program
# AUDLOGFAIL will also show up here
# We will test for all mode including TCP, TLS, UNIX Socket by setting up appropriate restrict.txt
# But we will not start audit listener so that AUDCONNFAIL error will show up (also AUDLOGFAIL)
