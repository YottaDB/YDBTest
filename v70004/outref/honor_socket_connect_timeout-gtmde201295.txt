# GTM-DE201295 - Test the following release note
# *****************************************************************
#
# Release note http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-004_Release_Notes.html#GTM-DE201295 says:
#
# > SOCKET device OPEN better honors timeouts; similarly, USE for
# > a SOCKET honors an implicit zero timeout. Note that very short
# > timeouts, particularly zero (0), may be unsuitable for dealing
# > with the timing of some network events, and thus may need
# > adjustment to avoid timing out after this correction.
# > Previously, these commands did not start their own timers to
# > bound the operation, causing the CONNECT to only check for a
# > timeout condition when some other process, or operating system,
# > event interrupted the process. (GTM-DE201295)
#
# The first test case entitled "testing connect to 244.0.0.0"
# tests the Release note. It fails on v7.0-003 and earlier
# versions, and passes from versions v7.0-004.
#
# Further test cases entitled "testing timeout behaviour..." are
# not directy related to GTM-DE201295, but they test similar edge
# case situations with different timing values, see details in the
# .csh file comment. Some of these cases (0-0-0 and 0-0-2)
# - pass v7.0-003 and before,
# - fail on v7.0-004 and v7.0-005,
# - pass newer versions.
# Other tests cases do not fail on any version, these have been
# left here in order to detect possible future bugs.
