# GTM-F166755 - Test the following release note
# ********************************************************************************************
# 
# Release note (from http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-004_Release_Notes.html#GTM-F166755)
# 
# By default, the MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE retries file copy operation once if the first attempt fails for a retriable reason;
# this is equivalent to -RETRY=1. -RETRY=0 prevents any retries, so if the copy fails MUPIP immediately reports an error.
# Additionally, any copy failure error messages include region information when displaying OS service error codes.
# Previously, while the default was equivalent to -RETRY=1 that incorrectly meant one BACKUP attempt, -RETRY=0 did not perform
# a backup, and error reports did not identify the region associated with the failure. (GTM-F166755)

# According to release note, There are 4 cases that will need to be tested
# 1) MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE equivalent to MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE -RETRY=1
# 2) -RETRY=0 will perform backup without any retries
# 3) RETRY=1 fails the first attempt but succeeds in the retry
# 4) Copy failure error messages include region information when displaying OS service error codes

# But some tests already tested (Discussion in https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDBTest/-/merge_requests/2043#note_201410428)

# From the discussion, We concluded that this test will only test 2 topics from release note.
# 1) MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE equivalent to MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE -RETRY=1
# 2) -RETRY=0 will perform backup without any retries

# And topics will NOT get tested in this test:
# 3) RETRY=1 fails the first attempt but succeeds in the retry (Tested in v70001/gtm9424)
# 4) Copy failure error messages include region information when displaying OS service error codes (Tested in v70001/gtm9424)

# Test 1) MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE equivalent to MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE -RETRY=1
# This means both MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE and MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE -RETRY=1 will retry only once
# Previously, This will perform backup 1 attempt without any retries
# Expected same amount of retry (1 retry) for both MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE equivalent to MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE -RETRY=1

# Create temporary destination file

# Change the permission to make this file not writable (This will cause BKUPFILEPERM error)
# Perform  MUPIP BACKUP -DATABASE for region DEFAULT

# Need to use [-replace] to be able to overwrite an existing target file

# Test 2) -RETRY=0 will perform backup without any retries.
# Previously, This will not perform backup and and error reports will not identify the region associated with the failure

# Note : There is an issue in the GT.M version older than V7.0-004 which says "Backup completed successfully"
# Even though it not doing any backup at all, which is wrong. So, the output is not matched with release note message below:
# "Error reports will not identify the region associated with the failure"
