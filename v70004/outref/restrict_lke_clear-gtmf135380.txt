# Release note (http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-004_Release_Notes.html#GTM-F135380) says:
#
# > The LKECLEAR keyword in the GT.M restrictions file prevents
# > the use of the LKE CLEAR command by unauthorized users,
# > while the LKE keyword prevents any unauthorized use of the
# > LKE utility. Previously the only way to restrict the use of
# > LKE was by setting the authorizations on the executable; there
# > was no way to allow the use of LKE while blocking the use of
# > LKE CLEAR. (GTM-F135380)
