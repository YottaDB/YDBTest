You must have a backup of database ##TEST_PATH##/mumps.dat before you proceed!
An abnormal termination can damage the database while doing the certification !
Proceeding will also turn off replication and/or journaling if enabled
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proceed? [y/n]:
Certification phase for database ##TEST_PATH##/mumps.dat beginning
%YDB-E-DBRDONLY, Database file ##TEST_PATH##/mumps.dat read only
Now make db read_write
run dbcertify again,should be fine here
%YDB-I-DBCDBCERTIFIED, Database ##TEST_PATH##/mumps.dat has been certified for use with GT.M V5
Before switching to version V5, make database read-only again
Switch to V5 version
