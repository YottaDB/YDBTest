# Test of various SimpleAPI/SimpleThreadAPI errors
# Now run errors*.c (all tests driven by a C routine)

### Test that any SimpleAPI call after using a SimpleThreadAPI call returns YDB_ERR_SIMPLEAPINOTALLOWED error ###
# Invoke ydb_set_st() to initialize SimpleThreadAPI environment
# Test SimpleAPI functions for YDB_ERR_SIMPLEAPINOTALLOWED error
