# GTMF-135428 - Test the following release note

#
# Release note (from http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-003_Release_Notes.html#GTM-F135428)
#
# > If the index for the $ZSOCKET() function is outside the range
# > of attached sockets for the specified SOCKET device, $ZSOCKET()
# > returns an empty string. Previously, if prior actions on the
# > SOCKET device removed one or more sockets, $ZSOCKET() could
# > return stale or invalid information, or cause a segmentation
# > violation (SIG-11).
#
# The test is a server-client pair. The steps seems crazy, but
# all of them are needed to trigger a SIGSEGV on previous
# versions.
#
# The client connects to the server, and sends a character 'c'.
# When the server receives the character, it closes the client
# connection.
#
# Then, the server closes the connection again, and catches the
# SOCKNOTFND error.
#
# After the server tried to close the already closed connection,
# the client attempts to sending an 'x' character.
#
# The server waits (with LOCK mechanism) the client to send the
# message, then lists the socket connections, retrieving
# information with $ZSOCKET command. It should report empty
# string for the closed client connection.
#
# This test is not 100% stable, when it fails, it randomly
# produces two type of errors: ASSERT/SIGSEGV and output
# difference. The release notes mentions SIGSEGV, but because
# both kind of errors are good indicators of the mailfunction,
# this is OK.
#
# Version v70001 server side program produces assert/SIGSEGV
# in ca. 90% of cases, dbg mode:
# >     20 %GTM-F-ASSERT, Assert failed in /Distrib/YottaDB/V70001/sr_port/op_fnzsocket.c line 444 for expression (socket_connect_inprogress >= socketptr->state)
# Pro mode:
# >     20	%GTM-F-KILLBYSIGSINFO1, GT.M process 36471 has been killed by a signal 11 at address 0x00007F320459FD71 (vaddr 0x00007F38F9DFC538)
# >     21	%GTM-F-SIGMAPERR, Signal was caused by an address not mapped to an object
#
# The remaining 10% produces unexpected output on server side:
# the status of the index-1 socket should be empty string,
# (as release notes mentions), not "CONNECTED". The failing test
# will look like (both dbg and pro mode):
# <     24	    index-1: []
# ---
# >     24	    index-1: [CONNECTED]
#
# The version v70002 should produce no errors.
