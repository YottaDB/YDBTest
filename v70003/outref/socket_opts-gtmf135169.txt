# *****************************************************************
# GTM-F135169 - Test the following release note
# *****************************************************************
#
# Release Note says:
#
# > The OPEN and USE commands for SOCKET devices support
# > assigning characteristics maintained with the POSIX
# > setsockopt() service using the OPTIONS deviceparameter
# > for the newly created socket or the current socket.
# >
# > OPTIONS=expr  Applies to: SOC
# >
# > The argument (expr) is a string which contains a comma
# > separated list of setsockopt options. If the option takes
# > a value, it is given after an equal sign (=) following
# > the option. The supported options are:
# >
# > - KEEPALIVE   - a positive value enables SO_KEEPALIVE.
# >                 A zero value disables SO_KEEPALIVE.
# > - KEEPIDLE    - sets the TCP_KEEPIDLE socket value.
# > - KEEPCNT     - sets the TCP_KEEPCNT socket value.
# > - KEEPINTVL   - sets the TCP_KEEPINTVL socket value.
# > - SNDBUF      - sets the size of the socket's network send
# >                 buffer (SO_SNDBUF) in bytes.
# >
# > Examples:
# >
# > USE dev:OPTIONS="KEEPALIVE=1,KEEPIDLE=50"
# > This enables SO_KEEPALIVE and set TCP_KEEPIDLE to 50 seconds.
# >
# > USE dev:OPTIONS="KEEPALIVE=0"
# > This disables SO_KEEPALIVE.
# >
# > _Note_
# > _For more information on the use of these options, please review_
# > _the man page for setsockopt . On Linux, "man 7 socket" and _
# > _"man 7 tcp" provide additional information._
# >
# > The $ZSOCKET() function supports an "OPTIONS" keyword which takes
# > an index argument and returns a string of the OPTIONS previously
# > specified for the selected socket. The string may not exactly
# > match the string originally specified but has the same meanings.
# >
# > The new keywords "KEEPALIVE", "KEEPCNT", "KEEPIDLE", "KEEPINTVL",
# > and "SNDBUF" return the individual items. If the system's current
# > value for the item doesn't match the value previously specified
# > with the OPTIONS device parameter, both values are returned
# > separated by a semicolon (";"): "uservalue;systemvalue".
# >
# > The "ZIBFSIZE" keyword may return the system value for SO_RCVBUF
# > in addition to the value from the ZIBFSIZE device parameter. Note
# > that the operating system may modify the values specified for
# > SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF so the returned values for those options
# > obtained with POSIX getsockopt() service may be different than
# > those specified using setsockopt(). (GTM-F135169)

# executing write-readback tests (displaying results later)

# ---- Write-readback test with strace logs ----
# The server sets options with OPEN or USE, then reading
# back the value with $ZSOCKET(). If the option is simple,
# $ZSOCKET() simply reports its value. If the option has
# constraints, e.g. buffer size has a high or low limit,
# $ZSOCKET() may report both user value (which has been
# set) and system value (the effective value). If user
# value and system value are different, $ZSOCKET()
# reports both value in "uservalue;sysvalue" format. If
# they are same, it reports only one value.
