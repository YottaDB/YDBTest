*****************************************************************
GTM-F135169 - Test the following release note
*****************************************************************

Release Note says:

> The OPEN and USE commands for SOCKET devices support
> assigning characteristics maintained with the POSIX
> setsockopt() service using the OPTIONS deviceparameter
> for the newly created socket or the current socket.
>
> OPTIONS=expr  Applies to: SOC
>
> The argument (expr) is a string which contains a comma
> separated list of setsockopt options. If the option takes
> a value, it is given after an equal sign (=) following
> the option. The supported options are:
>
> - KEEPALIVE   - a positive value enables SO_KEEPALIVE.
>                 A zero value disables SO_KEEPALIVE.
> - KEEPIDLE    - sets the TCP_KEEPIDLE socket value.
> - KEEPCNT     - sets the TCP_KEEPCNT socket value.
> - KEEPINTVL   - sets the TCP_KEEPINTVL socket value.
> - SNDBUF      - sets the size of the socket's network send
>                 buffer (SO_SNDBUF) in bytes.
>
> Examples:
>
> USE dev:OPTIONS="KEEPALIVE=1,KEEPIDLE=50"
> This enables SO_KEEPALIVE and set TCP_KEEPIDLE to 50 seconds.
>
> USE dev:OPTIONS="KEEPALIVE=0"
> This disables SO_KEEPALIVE.
>
> _Note_
> _For more information on the use of these options, please review_
> _the man page for setsockopt . On Linux, "man 7 socket" and _
> _"man 7 tcp" provide additional information._
>
> The \$ZSOCKET() function supports an "OPTIONS" keyword which takes
> an index argument and returns a string of the OPTIONS previously
> specified for the selected socket. The string may not exactly
> match the string originally specified but has the same meanings.
>
> The new keywords "KEEPALIVE", "KEEPCNT", "KEEPIDLE", "KEEPINTVL",
> and "SNDBUF" return the individual items. If the system's current
> value for the item doesn't match the value previously specified
> with the OPTIONS device parameter, both values are returned
> separated by a semicolon (";"): "uservalue;systemvalue".
>
> The "ZIBFSIZE" keyword may return the system value for SO_RCVBUF
> in addition to the value from the ZIBFSIZE device parameter. Note
> that the operating system may modify the values specified for
> SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF so the returned values for those options
> obtained with POSIX getsockopt() service may be different than
> those specified using setsockopt(). (GTM-F135169)

# CLI args for write-readback tests (wrtest^gtmf135169 and client^gtmf135169):
#
# 1: Random TCP port number
# 2: Case ID: "devopt-<n>"
# 3: Process ID: identifies server and client part of tests, used in logging
# 4: Run mode: informs M program if the program runs in foreground or
#    background. There should be only one foreground process, which shouldn't
#    exit until all background processes finish. See LOCK instructions in the M
#    program, `startup` and `clenaup` subroutines.
# 5: Options: options to test, in "index:o1=v1,o2=v2;index:o3=v3" format, where
#    index is the 3rd arg of $ZSOCKET(), o<n>=v<n> is option name and value.
#    Note that item separator is semicolon (";")
# 5 (parse) filename: strace output to parse
# 6: Commnand: the command to set options: `OPEN` or `USE`
# 7: Readback: read mode for checking the options: `INDIVIDUAL`` or `OPTIONS`
#    - `INDIVIDUAL` use $ZSOCKET(s,<option_to_check>,index) - for each option
#    - `OPTIONS` use $ZSOCKET(s,"OPTIONS",index) - once, it will report
#       almost all options
#
# When iterating through the parameters, some permutations has the same meaning:
# if there's no option defined for index 0, the case with OPEN and USE command
# are the same, these cases will be only mentioned and skipped (see
# isnotdupe^gtmf135169).
#
# Note that getting individual option value may differ from value set. When
# this happens, a masked value will appear instead of the value read.
# Similarly, system value appears ("usrval;sysval" format), if it differs from
# user-set values. System value is _always_ masked, except for KEEPALIVE, which
# is booleanish, it may has value only 0 or 1. Using "OPTIONS" as second
# parameter of $ZSOCKET() always provides user-set values.
#
# Each test case runs twice, with different readback modes:
# - "indv": reads back all the options set one by one,
# - "opts": reads back options at once.
#
# On SUSE systems, there are extra lines in the trace log, which should be
# filtered out (see "SUSE filter" comment below):
#   access("/dev/hugepages", R_OK|W_OK|X_OK) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)

The server sets options with OPEN or USE, then reading
back the value with \$ZSOCKET(). If the option is simple,
\$ZSOCKET() simply reports its value. If the option has
constraints, e.g. buffer size has a high or low limit,
\$ZSOCKET() may report both user value (which has been
set) and system value (the effective value). If user
value and system value are different, \$ZSOCKET()
reports both value in "uservalue;sysvalue" format. If
they are same, it reports only one value.
