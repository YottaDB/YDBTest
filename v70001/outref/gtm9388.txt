# Release note:
#
# ZSHOW "B" output consists of an entryref followed by any associated code with a
# right angle-bracket delimiter after the entryref. Previously the outbut only
# contained the entryref. (GTM-9388)
#
# The only part of this issue not yet tested is if no associated code is provided
# (either arg ommitted or arg specified as null). The first form is the most
# common form of ZBREAK (having an implied "B" command as a default), the second
# form has no legitimate purpose we can ascertain (the command intercept is done
# but no code runs so its just an expensive NO-OP), we test it in case it has some
# unforeseen purpose in the future.

# Drive gtm9388.m

# Execute a ZBREAK at zbreaknop with a non-existant code argument to see what happens:
# Command run: ZBREAK zbreaknop followed by ZSHOW "B"
zbreaknop^gtm9388>B

# Execute a ZBREAK at zbreaknop with a null-string code argument to see what happens:
# Command run: ZBREAK zbreaknop:"" followed by ZSHOW "B"
zbreaknop^gtm9388>

# Drive zbreaknop entry point to verify this does not break
Entry point reached with no problem
