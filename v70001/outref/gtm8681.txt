# GTM8681 - Release note:
#
# MUPIP BACKUP -RECORD provides a timestamp marking the start of backup when a backup
# a backup completes with no errors. The timestamp provides a backup date which is
# meaningful to operators without regard to when a particular transaction might have
# occurred. MUPIP DUMPFHEAD characterizes the timestamp as "sgmnt_data.last_start_backup",
# while DSE DUMP -FILEHEADER, labels it as "Last Record Backup Start". If a database has
# never been backed up with MUPIP BACKUP -RECORD, the utilities display "Never" for the
# field. Previously the -RECORD option stored only a starting transaction number. (GTM-8681)
