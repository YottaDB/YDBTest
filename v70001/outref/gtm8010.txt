# gtm8010 release note:
# OPEN "/dev/null" with deviceparameters works appropriately. The only deviceparameters
# GT.M actually attempts to implement for /dev/null are [NO]WRAP and EXCEPTION= and, at
# least in theory, the device should never give an exception. Previously, such an OPEN
# handled deviceparameters inappropriately, which could cause unintended WRAP behavior
# or an attempt to instantiate an exception handler constructed out of garbage, which,
# in turn, could cause a segmentation violation (SIG-11). The workaround was to specify
# no deviceparmeters on an OPEN of /dev/null. In addition, GT.M appropriately handles
# EXCEPTION= values settings whose lengths are between 128 and 255 bytes long. Previously,
# GT.M mishandled such settings potentially resulting in a segmentation violation (SIG-11).
# The second issue has not been reported by a customer, but was observed in development.
# (GTM-8010)
#
# Since the first part of this issue ([NO]WRAP, EXCEPTION= SIG11s) was addressed in YottaDB
# by YDB commit YDB@5a7d473c and tested by a4a3bbab, we only implement the "In addition," part
# of the above release note.
#
# Test explanation:
#
#   - Starts with an exception string that increments the variable errcnt if the exception
#     string is driven.
#   - Start a loop that does 26 iterations.
#   - Each iteration adds a "SET x=nn" command to exception string where nn is the iteration
#     number.
#   - Each iteration prints out the iterations and the exception string length. The actual
#     string is written to gtm8010_exception_string.txt so the longer length strings do not
#     pollute the reference file.
#   - Then each iteration opens the null device using the exception string. We also do a USE
#     of the device and a short write before closing the device. If this all occurs without
#     error, the iteration passes. If an error occurs, we try to catch it so the subsequent
#     iterations continue. Of course if a SIG-11 occurs, it is all over but this test does
#     not seem to evoke that type of failure on older releases.
#
# More on why no SIG-11:
#   The fix made for the SIG-11 was identified. It came from the fact that the single byte
#   length field was loaded into an integer without cast so value came in as a signed char.
#   This means that for lengths from 128 to 255, the length field of the exception string
#   was seen to be negative. There are several potential places a negative value can get
#   into trouble. In the upstream case, it seems to have usually produced a SIG-11. But
#   this particular test has seen both assert failures (running r1.38 debug) and more
#   commonly, we get this STACKCRIT failure on V70000 (and r1.38 pro) and earlier releases
#   that stems from an INDRMAXLEN error trying to compile the exception string and it
#   re-invoking handlers and looping until it gets STACKCRIT.
#
#   So the bottom line is that this test is having the same problem as the original issue,
#   but it is manifesting itself in multiple and different ways than the original issue
#   only reporting it ended in a SIG-11 if it ended badly.
