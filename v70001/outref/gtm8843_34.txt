# These similar cases trigger errors for WRITE /BLOCK(x)
# commands, where x is "COUNT", "CLEAR" and "SENT". There are
# pairs, one of them produce error, the other one does not.
---- server ----
     1	# server: waiting for client
     2	# server entered checkpoint 1 - client connected
     3	# server left checkpoint 1 - client connected
     4	# server entered checkpoint 2
     5	# server left checkpoint 2
---- client ----
     1	# client: connecting to server
     2	# client entered checkpoint 1 - connected to server
     3	# client left checkpoint 1 - connected to server
     4	# COUNT without local var ref should produce error
     5	executing command: write /block("count")
     6	error caught, test passed: %YDB-E-SOCKBLOCKERR, WRITE /BLOCK error: COUNT requires local variable passed by reference
     7	# COUNT with local var ref shouldn't produce error
     8	executing command: write /block("count",.a)
     9	no error, test passed
    10	value of a=0
    11	# CLEAR with argument should produce error
    12	executing command: write /block("clear",b)
    13	error caught, test passed: %YDB-E-SOCKBLOCKERR, WRITE /BLOCK error: CLEAR does not take an argument
    14	value of b=<undef>
    15	# CLEAR without argument shouldn't produce error
    16	executing command: write /block("clear")
    17	no error, test passed
    18	# SENT without local var ref should produce error
    19	executing command: write /block("sent")
    20	error caught, test passed: %YDB-E-SOCKBLOCKERR, WRITE /BLOCK error: SENT requires local variable passed by reference
    21	# SENT with local var ref shouldn't produce error
    22	executing command: write /block("sent",.c)
    23	no error, test passed
    24	value of c=0
    25	# client entered checkpoint 2
    26	# client left checkpoint 2
