# Release note (from http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-001_Release_Notes.html#GTM-9382)
# 
# GT.M appropriately handles symbolic links and relative paths in the ##SOURCE_PATH## path. In V7.0-000,
# GT.M issued a GTMSECSHRPERM or SYSCALL error when the first process attempting access to a previously
# quiescent database file had read-only permissions to the file. Other actions that require gtmsecshr
# (e.g., when dealing with processes or resources created or owned by a different user, such as waking
# or checking for the existence, and removing or instantiating a resource, such as semaphores, shared
# memory or socket files) could result in such error messages as well. The workaround was to avoid
# symbolic links and relative paths for V7.0-000 (GTM-9382)
# 
# Create database mumps.dat
Files Created in ##TEST_PATH##:
Using: ##SOURCE_PATH##/mumps -run GDE
mumps.gld
Using: ##SOURCE_PATH##/mupip
mumps.dat
# Set read-only permission on mumps.dat
# Set soft link from [./gtmdist] in current directory to [$gtm_dist] and reset [gtm_dist] env var to point to [./gtmdist]
# Access database using [$gtm_dist/mumps] now that $gtm_dist is a soft link to the real $gtm_dist.
# We do not expect any error. With GT.M V7.0-000, we would see a %GTM-E-GTMSECSHRPERM error at this point.
# Note that with GT.M V7.0-001 and later versions, we do not see the %GTM-E-GTMSECSHRPERM error but do see a
# [gtmsecshr not named gtmsecshr] error. None of the YottaDB builds though issue this error (which is good).
# So while this test does not pass with GT.M V7.0-001, it does show a difference in behavior between V7.0-000
# and V7.0-001 and is therefore considered a good test.
# Set read-write permission back on mumps.dat
# Validate DB
