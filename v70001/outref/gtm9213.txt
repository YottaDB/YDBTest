# GTM9213 - Release note:
#
# GT.M accepts SET $SYSTEM=expr, where expr appends to the initial value up to the length
# permitted for an initial value; an empty string removes any current added value. Initial
# values are determined by the $gtm_sysid environment variable always preceded by "47,".
# Previously, an attempt to SET $SYSTEM produced an SVNOSET error. (GTM-9213)

# Drive ^gtm9213

# Initial value of $SYSTEM: $SYSTEM="47,gtm_sysid"

# Set ',a multi-word extended value' as the trailing portion of $SYSTEM
  ** Got expected value: 47,gtm_sysid,a multi-word extended value

# Set ',a different shorter value' as the tailing portion of $SYSTEM
  ** Got expected value: 47,gtm_sysid,a different shorter value

# Set empty string as the trailing portion of $SYSTEM
  ** Got expected value: 47,gtm_sysid
