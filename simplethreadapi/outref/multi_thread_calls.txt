# Test of YDB@a455fff6
# --------------------
# Compile multi_thread_calls.c (that does multi-threaded calls into ydb_tp_st() at same time) into binary multi_thread_calls
# Run multi_thread_calls in background in a repeat loop 100 times
# Run 16 such sets of background loops to load the system
# Previously this used to cause a SIG-11.
# We expect no output below as if there was a SIG-11, the test framework would have found core files and failed the test
# Wait for backgrounded processes to finish
