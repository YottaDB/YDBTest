### Test Functionality of ydb_message_t() in the SimpleThreadAPI ###

# Test ydb_message_t() with the errnum for YDB_ERR_PARAMINVALID: -151027770
ydb_message_t() returns 
%YDB-E-PARAMINVALID, !AD parameter specified in !AD call

### Test Error scenarios of ydb_message_t() in the SimpleThreadAPI ###
# Test of YDB_ERR_UNKNOWNSYSERR error
Line[70]: 151027906,(SimpleThreadAPI),%YDB-E-UNKNOWNSYSERR, [2147483647] does not correspond to a known YottaDB error code
and msg_buff remains unchanged

# Test of YDB_ERR_INVSTRLEN error
Line[90]: 150375522,(SimpleThreadAPI),%YDB-E-INVSTRLEN, Invalid string length 56: max 5

# Test of YDB_ERR_PARAMINVALID error
# Test with msg_buff->buf_addr = NULL
Line[109]: 151027770,(SimpleThreadAPI),%YDB-E-PARAMINVALID, NULL msg_buff->buf_addr parameter specified in ydb_message_t() call
# Test with msg_buff = NULL
Line[118]: 151027770,(SimpleThreadAPI),%YDB-E-PARAMINVALID, NULL msg_buff parameter specified in ydb_message_t() call

### Test Functionality of ydb_timer_start_t()/ydb_timer_cancel_t() in the SimpleAPI ###

# Test ydb_timer_set_t() sets a timer which will consequently call a handle function.
# Execute ydb_timer_set_t() with limit_nsec set to 3 seconds
ydb_timer_start_t() successfully called timer_done()
Correct amount of time passed after ydb_timer_start_t()

# Test ydb_timer_cancel_t() cancels a set timer, which prevents the handle function from being called
# Set ydb_timer_cancel_t() to cancel after 1 second
ydb_timer_start_t() successfully cancelled
