### Test timeout in ydb_lock_st() and ydb_lock_incr_st() works correctly ###
First lock ^lock2 in child
Wait for child to have done LOCK ^lock2
Attempt to lock ^lock2(42) in parent : Expect YDB_LOCK_TIMEOUT error
Lock timeout test PASSED for ydb_lock_st() : Timeout expected = 1 or 2 seconds. Actual timeout = 1 or 2 seconds
Attempt to lock +^lock2(42) in parent : Expect YDB_LOCK_TIMEOUT error
Lock timeout test PASSED for ydb_lock_incr_st() : Timeout expected = 1 or 2 seconds. Actual timeout = 1 or 2 seconds
