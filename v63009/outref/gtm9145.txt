# Test to check how well ^%RI and ^%RO handle long code line lengths up to 1MiB.
# YDB will automatically break up lines longer than 8KiB since it will exceed the code line length limit.
# Previously the code line length limit was 2044 characters.
# This test verifies that the code line length limit is now greater than 2044 characters and will not have
# an increased line count using both ^%RI and ^%RO.
