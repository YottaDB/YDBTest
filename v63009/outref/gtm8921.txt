# Tests that R/O databases are rundown correctly. Prior to V63009, the semaphore was not properly run down

# Creating MM database
Files Created in ##TEST_PATH##:
Using: ##SOURCE_PATH##/mumps -run GDE
mumps.gld
Using: ##SOURCE_PATH##/mupip
mumps.dat
# Set database to read/only (turning off stats as can't share stats with read/only else get READONLYNOSTATS error)
Database file mumps.dat is now read-only
Database file mumps.dat now has sharing of gvstats set to FALSE
# Briefly open database for a moment with DSE to see if it leaves any IPCs laying around
# See if any IPCs were left over - If any IPCs show up here, the test fails as there should be none
Test PASSED
# Rundown the file to clean any leftover IPCs. Note the only reliable way to get rid of this IPC on prior
# versions (V63008 or prior based versions) that create it is to undo the read-only specification and only
# THEN run it down.
Database file mumps.dat is no longer read-only
