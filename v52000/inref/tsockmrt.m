; [C9H03-002835] Test the MOREREADTIME socket device option.
;
; - Create a string to send 1000 bytes long.
; - For each MOREREADTIME of -2(undefined morereadtime),200, 100, 50, DEFAULT:
;   - Open a socket with no delimiters.
;   - ZSHOW the device
;   - Fork off a receiver process
;   - Record start time
;   - Send random 10-20 byte chunks of the string to the receiver.
;   - After each chunk, the sender waits for the full string to be returned (with a fixed length read).
;   - Receiver echos the received data in 3-5 byte chunks.
;   - Record ending elapsed time.
;   - Check that elapsed is less than previous elapsed (runs should be getting better or at least no worse).
;     [Update: Since some platforms (notably AIX and Tru64) seem to get the same dismal numbers for several of the
;      mrt settings, the rule is now that subsequent runs must not increase by more than 15%]
;   - Close down receiver process
