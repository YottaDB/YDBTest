# Copy inref files into working directory and strip "subtestname-" prefix.
# This is useful if we have two subtests that want to use the same routine name, say a.m,
# but subtest1-a.m and subtest2-a.m are different.
#
# Also, in the relink test suite, the convention is to append some source files with ".edit{1,2,3..}".
# These files are stored in $gtm_tst with an additional ".m" extension, so while unpacking, go ahead
# and strip trailing ".m" from filename.edit*.m
#
# see: test/java/u_inref/unpack_java_src.csh
#
