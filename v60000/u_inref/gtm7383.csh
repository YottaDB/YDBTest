# Automation Plan :
# Run updates with a)before image journaling and b)nobefore image journaling for 1) 5 seconds and 2) 60 seconds.
# strace/truss the above routine doing the updates and note down the number of fsyncs (for db and jnl) and msyncs (for db).
# The expectations are:
# * db fsyncs should be higher for long running updates with before image journaling
# * jnl fsyncs should be higher for long running updates (irrespective of before/nobefore and MM/BG)
# * db fsyncs should be exactly (1) for BG and nobefore image journaling (invoked during shutdown)
# * db msyncs should be exactly (1) for MM and nobefore image journaling (invoked during shutdown)

# We are only going to use the fsync numbers and not pwrite numbers. pwrite calls are actually higher in the nobefore case even
# though we avoid writes to the db during the epoch. This is because the nobefore case does a lot more updates in the same
# timeframe and due to the buffer cache not fitting the entire database, we need to keep flushing blocks even in the nobefore image
# case in order to be able to read/modify new blocks.

# check fails, find out how long each fsync took and for each second that it spanned count one more fsync than actually happened.

# fsync-per-second suggestion for later if such a failure happens again even with 2x. (and then increase # it back to 3x)
