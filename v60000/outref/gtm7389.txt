# test : Only DFL should exist when no global updates are done
# test : when a dse dump is done (i.e db flushed), DFL is incremented

STATS-I-PASS : On doing a dse dump, DFL increased exactly by 1
# Expect only DFL to be shown below
  DFL  : # of Database FLushes                   0x##MASKED##
# test : For just one update, most of the stats should be deterministic. Do a diff with existing output

# test : JBB and JFB should be non-zero and increase for every global update
# test : JFW should increase by everytime we write jnlfile on disk
STATS-I-PASS : JBB, JFB and JFW increased after jnl write operaion
# test : JFB should be greater than JBB
STATS-I-PASS : JFB is greater than JBB as expected
# test : JFL and JFS should increase for every journal update
STATS-I-PASS : JFL and JFS increased after jnl write operation
# test : The set/kill above should have increased the JRL count
# test : The process that did set/kill will write a pini/pfin record and thus increase the JRO count
STATS-I-PASS : JRL and JRO increased after a global update operation
# test : For the updates done above, journal extension should have been seen
# test : Since the updates all happened to the same global, database extension should not have happened
STATS-I-JEX. JEX is 1 as expected
STATS-I-DEX. DEX is not seen as expected

YDB>

YDB>
# test : For the updates done above database extension should have happened
STATS-I-DEX. DEX is 1 as expected

YDB>

YDB>
# test : For the updates done above more than one database and journal extensions should have happened
STATS-I-[JD]EX. JEX and DEX has increased as expected

YDB>

YDB>
# test : After the single update and hang of more than 6 seconds, a JRI record should have been written
STATS-I-JRI. JRI increased by 1 as expected
