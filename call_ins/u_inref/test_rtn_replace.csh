# Test condition that when:
#   1. A routine "artn" is on the M call stack.
#   2. That routine or some subsequent routine does an external call.
#   3. The external call does a call-in back into M mode.
#   4. A new version of "artn" created and driven.
#   5. The zlput_rname() routine looks back through the stack to see if a version
#      of "artn" exists on the stack. V63001A_R100 and earlier don't find the routine
#      as the search stops at the call-in boundary. This can cause the original artn
#      to explode most spectacularly. Post V63001A_R100 should find the routine and
#      "fork" the routine so the old routine stays around until it pops off the stack
#      while the new routine takes its place for all other matters.
#
# Test logic:
#   - If this test completes without a fatal exit producing a core file, then the test
#     passes.
#   - Else it fails. The presence of the core itself will result in test failure.
#
# Note this test fails with any version previous to V63002_R110.
#

#
# Build shared library to hold the external call in
