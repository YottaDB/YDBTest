# This test ensures that if ever the global directory and database have an out-of-sync values for access method, GT.M
# runtime works fine by honoring the value in the database.
# Even though this test is named with the online rollback TR#, this is only a minor part of the actual online rollback
# TR and the TR# is used for the want of a better name. The actual online rollback regression tests will be added to
# a separate test suite - online_rollback
