# Above section is the whole purpose of this test. After we crash the Update process, the receiver server will detect that it is NO more
# alive and will attempt doing a waitpid on it (to prevent the update process from becoming a zombie). In V5.4-002 and before, the
# waitpid was done with the child PID being 0 (due to a bug in receiver server initialization). Since the second receiver server also
# spawned helper processes, invoking waitpid with child PID 0 will hang until any of the child processes (in this case the helper procs)
# to change their state. Because of this, later attempt to restart ONLY the update process using -updateonly and any future commands will
# also hang. V5.4-002A fixes this by ensuring that the receiver server ALWAYS invokes waitpid with the PID of the most recent update
# process (taken from recvpool structure that is NOT yet removed and to which the receiver server has a handle to)
