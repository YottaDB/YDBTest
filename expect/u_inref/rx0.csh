# Procedure to test "r x:0"
setenv TERM xterm
expect -f $gtm_tst/$tst/u_inref/rx0.exp >&! rx0.outx
cat rx0.expected

# Comments from test/expect/inref/rx0.txt, the original test case
#
# The test rx0 cannot run like other test scripts because the main purpose of
# rx0 is to test the command "r x:0". It will timeout immediately if there is
# nothing ALREADY available. But our usual way to do the test is to do it by
# the instream.csh, which is exactly one of the ways that makes something
# ALREADY available to a read. I am trying to find another way to test it, but
# for now, you might want to do the test by hand. Just start the GT.M. and write
# the command "d ^rx0". And see if it PASS.

#
# rx0.m JOBs a second process that kills the first after a few seconds - when
# manually run this seems unnecessary (or even confusing), but is a residual from
# earlier attempts at more automation and is left for now. Also, on VMS V999 used
# for daily testing has $zv V9.9-0 and won't work since rx0start.com will have the
# wrong ver command.
#
# If you are running the same copy in a different server (if the files are in NFS), make sure you delete .o before you run again.

# It is now possible to run this test in an automated fashion from a single
# machine with expect. The expect execution command is (replace <HOSTNAME>):
# expect -f $gtm_test/T999/expect/u_inref/remote_rx0.exp <HOSTNAME> $gtm_test/T999 expect V990 p
#
# The following is cut'n'paste code. If the test fails anywhere, expect will hang
# due a pattern mismatch.
