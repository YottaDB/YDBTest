# Test that buffered IO writes inside external call are flushed when YottaDB process output is piped.
# Invoking command --> yottadb -run ydb589 | tee
# We expect "Hello, world!" written in external call (in ydb589) to be flushed and seen in output.
# Without the fix to YDB#589, this output would not be seen.
Hello, world!
