# Build executable [##TEST_PATH##/ydb576] from SimpleAPI C program ydb576.c
Run executable [##TEST_PATH##/ydb576]
# This test sets 2 different values both of the same length but having different first piece length
# In order to exercise the bug, this test does the ydb_set_s() call at different C-stack depths
# And initializes some memory in the C-stack at each depth to some non-zero value
# And uses random recursion depths for enhanced testing
# Without the code fixes of YDB#576, this test used to reliably fail with dbg and/or pro builds
