# In R1.26 and R1.28, auto-upgrading the database file headers would not set the flush_trigger_top field properly.
# It would be set to 0 instead of the current flush_trigger value. This test verifies that
# the flush_triger_top field is correctly auto-upgraded (i.e. does not require MUPIP -SET TRIGGER_FLUSH to fix)
# Creating a database in version R1.22, R1.24 or a GT.M version between V63003 and V63007
# Checking the current value of Flush trigger
Flush trigger                  960
# Switching back to current version
# Verifying that the file header has been automatically upgraded by
# checking that flush_trigger_top is set to 960
