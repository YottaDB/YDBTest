# Release note (from http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.1-002_Release_Notes.html#GTM-DE556760)
# 
# MUPIP UPGRADE correctly handles global trees with depths greater than supported by GT.M version 6.x, but possible when running version 7.x on a version 6.x database. Previously, attempts to upgrade V6 databases containing these tall global trees would result in a segmentation violation and the process would terminate early without upgrading the database. (GTM-DE556760)
# 

# The below tests force the use of V6 mode to create DBs. This requires turning off ydb_test_4g_db_blks since
# V6 and V7 DBs are incompatible in that V6 cannot allocate unused space beyond the design-maximum total V6 block limit
# in anticipation of a V7 upgrade.
# Create a V6 database

# Run MUPIP REORG to ensure tree depth > 7
# Perform phase 1 of in-place upgrade on region DEFAULT: MUPIP UPGRADE
# Prior to GT.M V7.1-002, this would fail with a segmentation violation like the following:
     %GTM-F-KILLBYSIGSINFO1, MUPIP process 56678 has been killed by a signal 11 at address 0x00005BFC8DE2EB89 (vaddr 0x0000006900000003)
     %GTM-F-SIGMAPERR, Signal was caused by an address not mapped to an object
# Perform phase 2 of in-place upgrade on region DEFAULT: MUPIP REORG -UPGRADE
# Prior to GT.M V7.1-002, this would fail with a MUNOFINISH error.
# This step is omitted from the GT.M release note, but is included here for completeness,
# per the upgrade instructions at http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.1-000_Release_Notes.html#upgrade.

# Verify that the maximum tree height/depth is 11 (new MAX_BT_DEPTH in GT.M V7.0-001 as part of GTM-9434)
# Previously, this was only 7. The above part of the test (thanks to the [mupip reorg -fill=0] already created
# a MAX_BT_DEPTH height global. So all we need to do now is to verify there are blocks from Level 10 to Level 0.
# Run [dse find -key] to verify that the Global tree path includes blocks from Level 10 to Level 0
# Also run [dse dump -block] of each of those 11 blocks to confirm the levels go from 10 to 0
